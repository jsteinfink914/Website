@GramSchwan @edwards_burner @SixersTre @katszn_ @wojespn simmons is coming off an allstar and all nba defensive team season and malik beasley is a role player, at least simmons and ant are close.
@ShaleEdman @NicoleMcMilllon If I were you, I would stop using the Pippen and Phil Jackson analogy. Kinda stupid harping on 1 teammate, who never even made it out of the 2nd round as the leader of a team with multiple allstar/NBA teammates
@MaffieuMufasa For a 3 time Allstar, 2 time NBA first team all defense, 24 year old emerging superstar that can guard 1 through 4. Still hasn’t reached his peak. Let’s be honest you can win a ship with Harden and KD why not add defensive and playmaking
@DavidZavac @BenAxelrod Rudy Golbert is. 2x allstar and 4x all NBA....

He's not a star either

@BrockWales @Artdemon323 @annaschaudhary @bronhistory So just so we're clear, a player can be dpoy, allstar, all nba, all nba def and he's a no name in your books, yes or no? Just a simple yes or no again so we can expose how your puny little brain works kid <U+0001F602><U+0001F602>
@MitchellRossman @jakeDclifton @JustRyCole Well when that player is called a allstar and gets a shit ton of money but doesn’t improve at all ever since he came to the nba while u see other players improve aka Greek freak u gonna be pissed off sixers shouldn’t have lost to the hawks and it’s Ben fault
Ben Simmons is a multiple time allstar and one of the 5 best defenders in the nba — he is not in the top 25 when it comes to the worst contracts in the nba. 

Hes 25 years old and has had a tough stylistic fit next to embiid. https://t.co/EXsJEvkvDB
Hell I love KPJ but niggas talking like he a 3x allstar chill Benjamin Simmons an Allstar and All NBA nigga
Fantastic look at Jaylen Brown @FCHWPO by @MarcJSpears on why representation matters.Brad Stevens always tells me “Jaylen is an exceptional basketball player,AllStar,but he’s destined to make a bigger contribution to our world than just hoops” Stevens is <U+0001F4AF>https://t.co/UK6xB3229k https://t.co/6N0rRpKdiS
@TrevStoresWFT There is no place he goes that will make the team he goes to better and satisfy the 76ers at the same time… cus 76ers don’t want young players or picks they want a legit nba allstar .. and no team has one to trade If they also still wanna compete … idk where he goes ?
@ESPNPlus @ESPNNBA @stephenasmith He’s a 3 time allstar , top 5 defender in the nba who lacks motivation? I’d take that every day of the week
@NYKfan10304 @STUDYTHEGOAT @ClippersNets You think based on what? Embid just lost to the hawks in the 2nd round. At least when Kyrie lost in the 2nd round to the bucks, the bucks had the best record in the NBA and MVP and Kyrie was the only allstar on the Celtics that year. So you think based on what?
@BenSimmons25 wow u stole a lot of money <U+0001F4B0> from the sixers and u can't shoot "Allstar" lmao<U+0001F606> your a bitch u cry baby!! u soft <U+0001F921>  u really aren't  built for this city but it doesn't look like so far no nba teams want your soft ass u little bitch.i hope the 76rs don't trade u.
@JazzJohnson10 @geola388 @JD_DUNHAM @wojespn So you would rather give up a allstar who could be a competent NBA scorer for Ben Simmons? Someone who can’t even shoot a free throw
So let me get this straight.

@J30_RANDLE leads @nyknicks to 4th seed makes the allstar (top 30 player).. get a all nba selection (top 15 player) got paid!!! But ya got him ranked 41!

No @RjBarrett6 while he's started his career on historical footing

@aznfusion77 @CadePistons @TheNBACentral Part 2:

And that's absurd nba lost the balance, most regular season games look like defenseless allstar games or 3pt shootouts. Players get TDs and 50 point ganes each night. Don't like this development. I prefer hard fought 99-97 games more than those d- intenseless 143-137 gms

@GoodmanHoops Remember that next season that he will be better than Zion lol..Zion could have been a nba allstar as a rookie
@KingPush19 @arxanii I mean wood was an injury away from being an allstar, simmons is an allstar, kpj showed flashes of an all nba caliber player at 20 so it’s normal to think he’ll take the next step, and green was the most nba ready scorer in the draft, along with a REALLY deep bench, 7-8 seed team
@spillgod1 @JusLoveTrey @RiqDaDon0 @ClutchPointsApp @blakegriffin23 @KingJames No idea why people can’t follow. It’s simple take two players from the 2021 1st team all nba and add randle or an allstar who averages 24 and 10. Then try to match that talent with one player from 3rd team all nba in 2021 and two non allstars, you will have a tough time
@RatedPG6275 @ClutchPointsApp @blakegriffin23 @KingJames Call them a super team if you want, but a 3rd team all nba kg, Allen immediately off of double ankle surgery and non allstar peirce all in their 30s isn’t even on the same planet as 1st team all nba top 5 in the nba bron and wade, with 24 10 allstar bosh, not even close
@R2RFrayo @ClutchPointsApp @blakegriffin23 @KingJames No they weren’t, KG was and 3rd team all nba, Paul peirce wasn’t and Ray Allen wasn’t but then added as a replacement to the allstar game when someone couldn’t play. Also Allen had double ankle surgery, PP missed half the season in 2007. Don’t make stuff up
@ballbeenlife1 @tzford @Kar33msBurner @ClutchPointsApp @blakegriffin23 @KingJames Yes because a 3rd team all nba player joining 2 non allstars one of whom just had double ankle surgery, is not the same at 2 first team all nba players joining forces and adding a 24 and 10 allstar. You are just a hater if you think that is the same
@ClutchPointsApp @blakegriffin23 @KingJames He’s wrong 1. KG Allen and Paul were in their 30s. 2. Celtics traded . 3 HUGE talent gap, KG was 3rd team all nba, Allen and Paul weren’t even allstars in 2007 (Allen was a replacement) lebron and d wade were BOTH 1st team all nba in 2010, bosh allstar, all in 20s
@JCrossover @Ballislife I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU JAMAL THE RESPECT FANS SHOW YOU??? THEN YOU DISRESPECT THIS BRO MJ FOR WHATEVER REASON? PETTY DUDE??? SO YOU THAT YOUNG TO NOT KNOW ONLY 2 PEOPLE IN NBA HISTORY DID MVP/DPOY/ALLSTAR MVP???

They call me NBA when I get on the court<U+203C><U+FE0F> (non-binary allstar)
Russ was a top 4 player in the NBA from the allstar game onward last year

He looks healthy rn too.

I’m calling it early. Russell Westbrook will be the best player on the Lakers this year.
@FootballKennel Approval of the lakefront development is a necessity. The draft  this year, a superbowl run plus next year's NBA Allstar game revenue will help push that through hopefully.

NBA needs to bring back players wearing their own jerseys in the Allstar games
@chmpagnemami No one cares about NBA games until after the AllStar Break.
@EmberCLE Maybe our 4 1st round draft picks who are NBA ready and borderline allstar Christian Wood and new signing Daniel Theis?
Or idk best rookie defender last year,Tate and Kenyon Martin Jr
Just say so if you hate the rockets lol
On this day last year we had former NBA &amp; ABA Allstar Swen Nater on the podcast! Incredible life &amp; basketball journey with great stories about John Wooden,NCAA titles,Bill Walton,ABA lifestyle, becoming a magician &amp; MUCH more!

Wait so @nba allstar weekend is in Cleveland?!
@san2five @TorreySmithWR That’s literally any PG in the nba besides Ben. Don’t sleep on Maxey. He may be MIP this year. I can easily see him making the allstar if Ben sits this out. He’s a younger John Wall. We need to use Ben to get a shooting scorer to open the paint. Not just a scorer.

Brandon Ingram has played for Luke Walton, Alvin Gentry and Stan Van Gundy. I’m not sure there’s a recent AllStar who has played for a worse collection of NBA coaches in memory.

The most overrated thing by fans is cap space for a rookie contract star. Somehow max space means you’ll for sure get max players. But why would they go play with a 3rd year all star/all nba player with nothing else when they can go play with a vet star that guys will flock to?

It’s great for the NBA. The 76ers pissed off their star player and eroded the relationship, now he’s leveraging his power to no longer be in a situation he’s unhappy in. Philly was trying to do the same thing. https://t.co/F1WKWKqFmF

However the Sixers desperate desire for a second superstar to pair with Embiid May have caused them to downplay the red flags with Simmons. The other problem is, the NBA is such a superstar driven league, that teams are far more easily held hostage when a big star wants out

Did recent update adjust college games difficulty? I was feeling miserable because they were impossible to beat but after the update I won the championship. Glad you fixed it. It was a BIG barrier for new players.
@RxckzMxxn @19Danieldad @HashMCd @scartonradio @jaycapskiii___ @Anthonysmdoyle @JJMaples55_MST Fuck no they aren't neck and neck. Embiid much better offensively, same level on defense, all star starter, all NBA first team, and MVP candidate. Of course he has flaws too like always being out of shape but overall much better player than Ben.

@stoneblender I truly hope he figures out that everyone in the NBA is gifted with athleticism and skills. He has to now work hard to be a star. He’s been able to get to the NBA with God given abilities and little effort.
The problem is that you already have guaranteed All Star production in Correa at the most important position in baseball. If Pena can come up and give you 80% of that then fine. But that is not guaranteed at all. It’s like betting on draft pick in the nba when you can get a star. https://t.co/ZKQHEBYFUg

You are the GM of a NBA team and your star player has knee surgery. After the surgery, the player is out of shape and overweight- do you let him return to action without restrictions against the advice of the team training staff?
And everyone else includes the labor not only the 400+ NBA players who don't have star equity, but everyone else also associated with teams. 

When fan based revenues dropped during Covid, stars weren't hurt, but hundreds of staffers were laid off.

I have RJ as an all star a good few times in his career and I see him as a consistent 20+ scorer and elite defender. But what’s scary is, if his work ethic remains and he keeps the improvements coming like we’ve seen, he’s probably a consistent all NBA guy which is insanely good.

@Clarson_97 He’s one of 22 players with 25k pts, 8 time all star, 2 time all nba
@Hawksrevengeszn @atlhawkstime11 He’s inevitably going to be the #1 option. I don’t see Randle as THE GUY in 2-3 years, even if he is the guy now. Randles great, but RJ’s improvements into an all star or all nba level player is what is going to make us true contenders.
@logosaetos @POPSUGAR @itsjojosiwa @JennaJohnson Transgender men are playing sports against girls cause they couldn't beat men. We can't have them feeling bad about themselves. Gay people can influence a who city. Bathroom bill in Charlotte called for the NBA to move the All star game cause they wouldn't let men in ladies RR.
@S2ENSE_ @FlippNoBirdie @ShannonSharpe It's not slander. An all star, all NBA, All defense, max player can't get you buckets in close games in crunch time unless he's positioned in the post. That's limited for someone with his talent. Even he's on some Joker level point center type, he's not a threat to score.
@FlippNoBirdie @S2ENSE_ @ShannonSharpe Name me any all nba all star not playing center that won't take a wide open 10 ft jumper in league history,  I'll wait.
@d00dbuffet @KendrickPerkins The fans?  Dude really. Did you watch any game at all. They cheered and encouraged a max NBA player who was scared to shoot a basketball.  He wasn’t booed.  Go back and take a look. Maybe you are watching too many of his workout videos against the ymca all star team.
@mommas_baby123 @ZachLowe_NBA Empty stats mean nothing and even the empty stats you provided don’t back up a superstar. A superstar is an all star starter almost every year, not getting into the game sometimes and making 3rd team all nba. He needed jimmy butler and thibs the only time he made the playoffs.
@BigJones5577 @mommas_baby123 @ZachLowe_NBA Keep telling yourself KAT is a superstar, lmk how that works out. Jokic went to the playoffs prior to Jamal Murray being a star. James harden did it for years in Houston before getting a second star. Kawhi in San Antonio. Superstars make the playoffs regardless

@simmnfierzig @LeQuan_God @Peak_Process @TomMoorePhilly @Will_Rucker3_AD You're entire reasoning is flawed &amp; faulty. Ben has real NBA value. All GMs agree. But because teams are so top heavy with max contracts, no team is looking to swap a star equal to Simmons because it's a sideways move and it doesn't make the 76ers better. It's not about value.
@DavidBr37616769 @BynumInDaPost @sixers @NBA @BenSimmons25 @dmorey This is dumb.

He is not hoping for an injury. What he's saying is that if Embiid is injured, there is no other star to carry the load.

The team quit on Ben last yr when they tried to send him to Houston until he is 30, after he signed his rookie max &amp; said he loved Philly.

@xst05 @PhillyRolls @Bodenderbyshir3 @msquirrel20 @sharpalright The league would also step-in. The NBA doesn’t want star players to just stop showing up just because they don’t like their situation, they signed a contract.
@ZachLowe_NBA @BobbyMarks42 @JonKrawczynski It's hard to remember a star quiting on a team as hard as Simmons with that much time left on his deal.

Harden and Butler might be used as examples but they had less time and at least showed up to camp.

It would be like harden not reporting after the clippers game in 2015

#NBA #HereTheyCome https://t.co/TIoN922Iae
Can we admit that @sixers star @BenSimmons25 is the biggest crybaby in the @NBA??? Ben Simmons has no talent and the #Sixers should not trade him and call his bluff to sit out the season.

Is @sixers star @BenSimmons25 the CRYBABY of the @NBA???

Something to keep in mind is that star players and their agents are forging the new path toward using trade requests in lieu of free agency. This doesn't help the majority of NBA players, who make up the most powerful voting bloc in the union.
@TalkinBaseball_ Maybe people were confused if it meant in one season or one game. Dropping 60 in basketball is impressive, but with almost everybody chucking up 3s and very little defense, scoring is a lot easier in the NBA now. Look at all star games, 160-150...

Ben Simmons is an all star and a legit top 30 player in my opinion and he’ll have a lot to offer the #warriors with or without draymond green. An elite playmaker and defender is a player any #nba team could use regardless of his shortcomings.

@wojespn Simmons has the attitude of an elite player when he’s really just a low level all star. This is something only a top 10 player should be able to pull. I blame the nba. players have too much power now and it has jeopardized the integrity of the sport
@YerminatorJay @Zekelife @Daleconnors5 @PBS stop talking basketball. how was he trash having 40/50 pt games? u sound stupid. no he was mj of old but he was still a all star. meaning he was still a top 20 player in the nba. that’s trash to you? stop talking sports.

@NoTechBen I think the Blazers would do that in a heartbeat but Philly would never. Simmons is younger, cheaper contract, and made 3rd team all NBA while CJ has never made an all star team and quietly just had a poor playoffs, is injury prone, and a bad defender.

@JtheGreatest__ Don’t matter if they not treating him like that, his market value an All star so u dnt trade nun period in no business if u dnt get equal value back. And it’s both they fault cause his ass won’t improve his game and he got a whole bunch of yes men around him so it’s both parties
@JtheGreatest__ The problem is it’ll be different if they rebuilding but they ain’t they a top seed they tryna keep that u know. And like I said he an all star can’t trade him for no. And honestly maybe ain’t nobody offered nun cause he trade value so low dnt nobody believe in him no more
@JtheGreatest__ He not a bad player, he just mentally weak right now. They wanna get rid of him but u can’t trade nobody that’s an All star and not get nun good back. That’s bad business you know
@dannyoneil Death, taxes and NBA star divorces…
@spiltrosetea Yes and piri is really in love with ame's pop culture from marvel to disney to star wars, etc (filos are known to be hype big fans) but other than that they would also talk about nba religiously <U+0001F602> honestly think piri spends a lot of time in ame's place to geek with him
@Determined_NBA Ah see that’s what I’m saying they not treating him like an all star. So In my opinion it’s the organization fault. They should’ve never let it go on and made a trade based off what was available then. Now you stuck in really bad business move. Finna be a bad season<U+0001F926><U+0001F3FD><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>
@ScottyDrowned @peakoko @ScoopB @ZachLowe_NBA @DSM_Media That’s still an all star goof ball. None of them including KAT are all stars if that’s your standard
@FCartoscelli3 If @boogiecousins was smart he goes to China. Where he will earn millions a year, reinvent his image, become a huge star and bank$. If he stays in the NBA he'll make squat wasting what little he has left sitting on a bench. Demarcus should turn lemons into lemonade. Go to China.

@ZionsDunk @713M4rti4n @FearTheBrown @Itamar_17_10 But if you look at NBA contracts right now, there really isn’t a middle class. It’s a bunch of maxes, rookie deals and smaller contracts. Not a bunch in the 18-25 range. I think accurately accounting for super star’s true worth, the middle class might come back

@FanMahome Harden in 2017 had one of the biggest Star collapse in nba history. After underperforming every playoffs, In do or die game 6 of 2017 WC semifinals, he took 11 shots total(2 inside 3 pt) for 10 points &amp; 6 TOs. That year he was 2nd in mvp vote. Did Rockets toss him under the bus?

@danfavale @btoporek @msjnba You wouldn’t consider 3-4 more all stars pulling this rampant? I would, because even though they may be equal in the eyes of the CBA, we all know players are not created equal. I’m not using the NBA player count as my population here, I’m using the All Star selections.

@CarmichaelDave Thing I don’t get is that a few months ago if this was our ninth pick instead of Davion, everyone would do it in a heartbeat. There’s only a 2 year diff between Mitchell and Simmons! One is undersized and never played an NBA game, one is 3x all star

Ben Simmons pros &amp; cons besides Basketball.

Pros: Even though he’s mixed blood, he’s Australian &amp; seems to be apolitical. This would suit teams with conservative fan bases as most star players tend to be progressive activists.

@BrookesyNat Worst kept secret in the NBA was that Morey had agreed to trade him for Harden, then it fell through, then his coach and star player shit on him on live tv. Sure he isn’t without blame but of course he’s going to try and use some leverage to get a better situation
But they were in different businesses tbh and not everyone cares for boxing or basketball. Jordan was a TV draw and the biggest NBA star ever but MJ was like known EVERYWHERE. At a time where accessibility was different https://t.co/0XZoA0QWB0
@SportsCenter @wojespn I don't get it ... Who cares he's a scrub.. not every NBA player is a star.
@TheRealHoarse @The_Barftender @itsjustTaj_ He’s an all nba player, 3x all star, 1st team all defense, and DPOY runner up. He’s only 25 and He’s definitely a star
@KGsGOAT Its hatd to leave out any of the guys i put if any probably magic tho but my reasoning was bill was the first and most succesfull star dr j was the merger MJ was the most popular and magic saved the nba from collapsong but youre right id probably take out magic for lebron
@russoj5 Two free agents swapping teams in a sign and trade over cap semantics is quite different than a star forcing his way to Boston for a reduced price. An All NBA player demanding Boston and torpedoing his trade market to get here has never happened.

@DCJ5359 @MikeMiss25 There's a 140 million reasons he should be held accountable. A NBA all star that's scared to shoot the ball is unheard of.
@Ike58Reese Why? These NBA players are sensitive and by Nov-Dec there's gonna be another star asking out somewhere. Can't win a ring with him here and not shooting anyway. His value ain't getting no worse so why take crap now. Him here get's us to the 2nd round just like him not being here.
NBA Twitter was telling the Sixers to trade a 25 year old Multi All Star Multi All Team a defense player for John Wall or CJ Mccolum..... And The Sixers were almost dumb to listen
Don’t let NBA Twitter fool you into thinking the young man not nice and not a star..... his trade value is right where it should be https://t.co/pc9lB4SVzY
@BrandonWint_ Lol first team all defense and all nba second team and an all star, it’s Ben’s fault for not getting better than the max contract he earned. Lol your fandom is tinting your perception.
@HLoc_Da_Gawd No he hasn’t CJ is not good enough. How many all star games CJ made? What’s his career assist to turnover ratio? How many all nba teams he made? He not good enough dame wouldn’t play off ball to someone not good enough Ben Simmons is clearly better than CJ at pg duties.
@FCKNJORDAN lol all nba second team. First team all defense. All star. He don’t shoot you right he is not unprofessional nothing he has done would indicate that. He didn’t bad mouth them, even they did bad mouth him he is within the rules of his contract. He asked for a trade. Gotta move on.
Sixers better not trade Ben Simmons for scraps. Don't trade him just to trade him. That's a 25 year old All Star/All NBA player.

@lhcoug Yeah because that's what the NBA needs is an all star team that no one can compete with. That sounds like must-see TV.
@BBrennanNBCS Welcome to dealing with NBA players. A 25 year old NBA star is like dealing with a teenager. He knows everything and wants his ass kissed. If the 6ers ever want to win, the fans need to wake up to reality. No nba players want to play here. This isn’t the NFL.

It’s apples-to-oranges, but that also increases the appeal during the regular season.

Y’all ruined the value of a 1st team all nba defense player who hasn’t hit his prime
@wojespn @sixers should let him dry on the bench or trade him to the worst possible team. Tantrum child, unable to accept his faults. Has the @nba already noticed this pattern with each star represented by @KlutchSports?
Has there ever been a more mentally soft "all Star" in NBA history more then Ben Simmons?
That said, it's really stupid of an NBA franchise to play this game with Rich Paul. He has the ear of too many star players and future stars. Poisoning that relationship won't end well for them.
@wojespn Available: 6’10” point guard who can pass, but can’t shoot at all, mediocre defense, can’t shoot free throws, and clams up in clutch time. Also, considers himself a mega-star. Philly wants all the 1st round picks.

@Bill_GoIrish I mean they have a good team but I’d definitely be more entertained by a Yankees series the Toronto makes it all they will talk about is drake like the nba all star game that year
@aklingus You're not wrong but Morey can't give up Simmons for nothing.  Pelicans set the bar for what teams need to bring to the table to get an all star in return.  But I think they're both misreading the room with regards to Simmons market value.  If I was an NBA GM I wouldn't sign him.
@LakerCentral365 I think Portland…

Dame is wasting another year of his prime if he stays, and Portland won’t get an all star / all nba type of talent in any other trade. Dame is a seamless fit for Philly and, while Simmons isn’t perfect, he’s a young, talented player for portland to build with.

@kingthorfinn1 @YamiSanKev @wojespn Can’t call a 3 time all star and 2nd team all nba player garbage

@manoffrm 100% because of the college angle. It might not happen first crack but eventually I think he gets in. Top 15 in 3’s made in NBA history. 0 all star appearances and no finals either definitely hurts him though but like I said with College I think it gets him in.
@ZCiavoPSN Everything you highlight still makes him an impact player. We would have won the NBA title with his impact and the teams defense and 3 point shooting. Rivers not only improved Danny Green but Seth and Tobias.....now you improve 20 points and 7 assist all star.  No brainer
@ZCiavoPSN Listen to you. Yes yes yes. Lol you are stating everything not only is Wall a five-time all star former NBA all defense. Through everything you said. He still averaged 20.6 points 7 assists. Still can defend. He played 40 games sat out most.  Ben 58 games. No brainer

Congratulations on a terrific career, JJ! When I was covering my first NBA games at 14 years old, JJ was a rookie and he was one of the first players to give me a one-on-one interview. He’s going to be a star in the media space; his podcast is one of my favorites. https://t.co/ji2npJV1od

Good news indeed.

I really like Cedric Ceballos and his time with the Los Angeles #Lakers. https://t.co/pCwYcXhGhM
Lol was all NBA 2nd team last year, All Star and most improved but yea there’s 40 players better than him… https://t.co/QtZonU7u7M
For a lot of men around my age JJ was Duke!! At the time didn’t start out as an NBA star but carved out a hell of an NBA career! Congrats to him!
@Charlie06141395 @moduswastaken @TimeGasoline @Danizeh @TheHoopCentral Dude ur a cancer.. What the actual fuck... Pippen was drafted and developed by mj.. Bron goes after all nba all star caliber player so there's a small chance of him losing he's always takes the easy road..
@CondensePapi i do believe Pascal will be a all star starter with KD and Giannis next season hopefully but it could be Embed with his  properlity but Siakam to me will be on the all nba second team again as well

@bradleyphlsmith Strongly disagree, he was an All Star PG but that time has long passed, he’s on one of the largest contracts in the league, and had serious injuries that have declined his game. It’s literally the most unmovable contract in the NBA and no GM is taking that.

@chriscejnar @JustCallMeQ3 @TheRealJHair Phil never coached a team like the '04 Pistons (zero stars) or 2011 Mavericks (one star surrounded by geriatric jump shooters) to an NBA title.

In fact he LOST to both those teams convincingly, which shows how overrated he actually is.

@agentzer012 nba players are the biggest sport stars in the country. and lebron is like THE biggest sports star by far. there's also more relatability with nba players because you're up closer, less people on the "field" at once, and you can see their faces. more dramatic parasocial relation
@Sageof6turtles Eh, idk almost every NBA champion that I can think of either had multiple stars or were really deep &amp; versatile with at least 1 star, or were historically good at a certain aspect (like the 2000s Pistons defense). That’s a lot more to do w/ team to me
@eepdllc @nyck37 Crazy how his ts% was only about 1% lower than RJs despite having 100x more creation burden. RJ in Ant's role would go horribly, because being an offensive engine isn't his game. But thats where pretty much every non-big star comes from
@DailyKnicksFS RJ is a well below average self creator and shooter off movement, is you can't do either of those things it's pretty impossible to be a star for non bigs imo. And yes ofc he's 21 but that doesn't mean I'm gonna project every 21 year old to become amazing lol
@LaltenNBA Have to imagine they’re aiming to consolidate in a star trade next summer considering their cap situation + all their young wings they have to pay very soon
@spurs_four @streakoswrld Every single player who's full name I wrote out got a star except Coby who i forgot. I don't think Thybulle is name searching "Matisse" lol
@HaleyCarrots Tie between Maria Howell, an actress and singer, and NBA star Eric "Sleepy" Floyd.
@DailyCaller @SheriffClarke It’s completely out of control now. This is all because of a brutal murder shown endlessly on TV. Do I have to stand for the black anthem? Doesn’t matter because I stopped watching NFL and NBA. Almost stopped MLB over the all star pullout decision but love that game too much.

@TairyGreen @WalkWithLyle @Sixers_Matt You’re right. If anything it should be easier to appease Ben, bring him back, raise his value again (because NBA fans have the memory of a fucking gnat) and then reevaluate things instead of TRADING AWAY A 25 y/o 3 TIME ALL STAR FOR ANYTHING LESS THAN A CHAMPIONSHIP RUN

@s_hiburizu Even then, I still think the players from the largest entry should take home more money than organizers. Do team owners, coaches take home more than an NBA star? Sometimes yes, other times no and would likely be the same for the FGC and esports in general.
@NerdschleifeMF He’s a pro at tantrums already. I keep joking that he’s destined to be an NBA star based on his flopping skills.
@BryanIsTheKing Put differently, I think you're thinking about it the wrong way. Lowry was already a world-class athlete, as a star NBA player, and yet the Heat's program got him into *noticeably* better shape. That's an amazing credit to Lowry's determination *and* the Heat's rigorous program.

Not sure why he hasn’t improved but hopefully he can find the right motivation in Houston or anywhere else. There’s too much talent in him, even with his very obvious limits - he’s still at a star level in the NBA. 

Recency bias is why most people are playing with his name.

Intangibles: Centered around the player or play captured in the moment; examples include:
-The star power of the player
-Magnitude of the play (game-winning shot)
-Type of play (a posterizing dunk vs an assist) (3/4)
@Reb4life777 @unlvfootball @coacharroyo I would be an NBA All Star if I had Lebron James Body.  Wish in one hand and $hit in the other.  You know the rest.  Defense is not good!  Magic won’t make it better!  The offense stinks and so does the defense.
@THR Why does the NBA have no white guys represented on the all star game!  Guess the blacks were better and no one complains !! Stop the racist garbage!!!

@netsin4117 @MotorCadeee @FunkyDiabetic1 Well they also had the best record in the NBA after the all star break even w/o Murray
Idk guys John Wall is a multiple time All Star 

One time all nba 3rd team and 1 time defensive team.

We should trade him for that bum Ben Simmons
@RedNationBlogga Yeah people have allowed the media’s narrative to change how he is viewed.. the man doesn’t shoot the ball at all and is still an All Star All NBA level player.. surround him with the right pieces and you’ll see how special he is
In the 2013 NBA Draft, the Cleveland Cavaliers would somehow again get the first overall pick, this would give the Cavs a perfect opportunity to give their rising star another piece to help- No.

They selected Anthony Bennett. Someone who was so terrible he was unplayable. 

Yay. https://t.co/cqp8RdTBve
@yeaitstrill This look like a 5 star restaurant compare to my school

And Charles Barkley and  Scotty Pittman join Houston

@geoffschwartz NFL is always making rules to try to eliminate star players so they can plug and play the league forever. Not the best wording, but it's an owners league opposed to a players league like the NBA

@BillyReinhardt A year ago Simmons for Wall + picks would be laughed at by PHI fans and anyone really. Simmons + Maxey + others was seen as the best star package in the NBA. If that's what they end up being forced into it's a colossal failure by PHI (even if they now have to bc of Ben hold out)
@DevaronPerry @ItsCavalier_Pod @KJG_NBA @JohnSuchan @AcrossCavs @cwmwrites @amadousow_ @BrownlojCLE @ArmchairQBDan @JustinMatch26 I think the media has made Garland into a future super star .  I'm not so sure he has the all around game to be that with his limited athleticism and quickness 

I think they've made him j to that because if quite frankly a dislike of  Collin Sexton and/,or the small backcourt...
@DevaronPerry @ItsCavalier_Pod @KJG_NBA @JohnSuchan @AcrossCavs @cwmwrites @amadousow_ @BrownlojCLE @ArmchairQBDan @JustinMatch26 Kinda as a way to try to get sentiment of their side to make the Cavs make a choice 

In being honest I've seen one player with Garland's skilset become a star like the media has said 

His name is STEPH CURRY
@Asadking2001 @houstonfan00 Not when you trade the worst asset in the NBA for a multi time all star who's 26!
@DNVR_Nuggets The DNBA crew has to start its own NBA franchise and each of the guys on the mailbag today has to be assigned one of these 4 roles: GM, head coach, star player and arena announcer. How do you guys see those getting assigned? (bonus points if you find a role for Vogt too)
@padresfangirl @BenAndWoods Look at the NBA, star players dictate the coaching, the type of team that gets put together, they can ask to be traded etc. Star players have massive amounts of influence, the team has committed more to them than any coach or GM.

@justgotdone1 @LevitatingWolf Jordan never won championships until he had help in the form of a 2nd star. That is how the NBA has worked historically with very few exceptions.

Proof of how talented #NBA players are. Shabazz Napier was a reserve in the league but overseas is a star. Had 33 PTS + 4 AST. So many former #NBA guys go kill overseas. Lance Stephenson, Mario Hezonja, Nikola Mirotic, Jeremy Lin, and Greg Monroe to name a few. #Euroleague #Zenit https://t.co/rhSlLmXQf1
@Kawhi2SZN_ “Not wanting to play” isn’t an excuse for losing. If you play in the NBA you have to have sufficient desire to win. And the Heat being without a borderline star and a role player is nothing compared to the injuries that benefitted the 2019 Raptors and 2021 Bucks.
@FanMahome @freexander @DJWankee @TheNBACentral @SiriusXMNBA Yea sure.. dudes who suck don't get multiple all star selections. Make all nba and all defensive teams and runner up for dpoy awards.. log off

@FF00701 Fasho but.. he would take like 30 shots to get it. Look beyond dude, Kobe would usually shoot 45-50% of his teams shot as a whole. Tbh any star player in the nba can have those exact numbers if they had the green light to shoot as much as Kobe did.
@KnixFix @forevershinin @NBA_NewYork @carmeloanthony @mworthofgame So true! MSG is the toughest arena to defend in all of sports. Knicks are automatically-6 at home because star players continually drop career highs.. melo had one good year w/ Knicks because Tyson Chandler(DPOTY) picked up Melo’s Slack that year
@NBAReactz @ThereChiGoes top to bottom that’s where the hawks excel lmaooo they have the deepest roster in the NBA, thought u would’ve said star power bc that’s the only advantage boston has really, that and probably defense, hawks have more shooting, better rebounders, better bigs and guards
@BuiltDiffy @LegendOfWinning I mean jokic is one of the best passers ever. If you were gonna have a problem with anything he just said maybe it’s the all nba signs part but I 100% agree mpj will show the signs and be in all star convo this year. 24+ ppg 7.5 rpg on 48/41/86 splits is my prediction

@KieferEdwards @UNLVRebelGrl @jesse_1926 @Rob_Sellers_ @TArceneaux21 Geez you guys are amazing.  By now he committed to Houston.  It was his chance to play for a former NBA coach that took his team to the Final Four. And the Sweet 16.  And has had 4-star athletes before. And is adamant he doesn’t want 1and done.  Passed on several of them.
@khris_money25 @UHCougarMBK @CoachSampsonUH @UHCougarMBK One of the really great advantages UH offered even at the G-5 level was Kelvin Sampson’s experience as an NBA coach. He had so much more to offer than the typical college HC. That will continue to be a major attraction for recruits of any star level.

Thing i hate about today’s nba is. Not many players are as SKILLED as the OG’s . These players 95% raw talent and genetics. It’s not because they went got it and worked for it. All star games show you how unoriginal these players are. They not skilled like they used to be

@BleacherReport Don’t care he’s on the team with the laziest players in the nba. Dude was a bum at 6 2 then grew to 6 10 and became a star. Cousy, Heinsohn, Russel, Havlicek, bird, pierce Tatum all are where they are cause of hard work

@NicoleMcMilllon @CoachQues Damn you’d think by the way you talk about him that he wouldn’t even be an NBA player. Much less a 4x champion, 4x FMVP, 4x MVP, most All NBA 1st Teams ever, most all nba ever, on the verge of most all star ever, a scoring and assist champ, with countless other records

@ShannonSharpe College teams use to beat nfl teams in all star games. College players use to beat nba  all stars in 80s. Depends how good team is. College team beat Jordan / Barkley in 88 exhibition with John Thompson as coach

@6BDORS Messi Versus Ronaldo is fucking boring. 
Plastic NBA fans who haven’t seen a live football match are those that care. 
Football teams have 11 players. 
Liverpool vs Man U,  Red Star v Partizan are rivalries that actually matter.
@Cr7ToManchester @SpursOfficial @IWC Real fans don’t give a fuck about Ronaldo vs Messi.  They care about real rivalries — those that exist between teams: 
Liverpool vs Man U, Celtic vs Rangers, Partizan vs Red Star, Milan vs Inter. 
The rest is bollocks for third world fanboys and NBA watchers.
And this is why I am so disappointed in the sports community! All these star athletes folded! Took the jabs or worse :pretended to take it to make us take it! Very pissed off! Shame on the #NHL #CFL #Nfl and #nba https://t.co/DMN3jhafeM

@BobbySm31186296 @KySportsRadio Since 2015, what has Cal done to be in a Final Four? Does he get the kids who are 1 star or 2 star and turn them into legends at UK? No. That's what our tradition is. Not #1 recruiting classes to get players to the NBA. That doesn't win championships.
@BobbySm31186296 @KySportsRadio My bad. 4 star. No one outside of UK and Duke care about who they get into the NBA. Meanwhile, other programs are winning AND outcoaching Cal at the same time. You can see it in a bunch of games the last 6 years. After 2012, Cal changed

@OMagicDaily It's the same degree of assumption that you place on slow rebuild. Except Simmons has established proof of NBA star tier talent &amp; winning games.

Suggs/Simmons tandem will peak national interest &amp; it definitely has higher upside than anything ORL has going now or in past decade.
@OMagicDaily Nah, that decision had a totally different ORL and NBA context.

Simmons is better than any player ORL has had since D12.   He's a bonafide star tier talent who just turned 25.

You can play him as a PF/C that can facilitate exponentially better than Vuc.

@linzsports I don't know how it works with local rights.  I don't think it could simply be transferred to ESPN.  But it's not on NBA TV because they're showing the Aces-Sky game.  Makes sense, show the game that has more star power.  At 7:30 is WNBA Weekly.  Check it out.

Kobe did what every nba star today does when they want more help. They threaten the organization. 

Back then, the team usually held all the cards (not negotiating with terrorists was the logic). But Kobe pulled a D-Wade.
"[Anthony Edwards] was 6th in total pull-up 3P [post-All-Star]. And his [3P%] on those shots (38.7) topped 3 of the players ahead of him on that list (CJ McCollum, Jayson Tatum and Luka Doncic).

"Over that same stretch, he was 9th in points from drives."

@NBAAndre2K21 Not legitimate if he even casually followed high school or college basketball since 2015.

He was a star in his role. Just because he wasn't offensively inclined doesn't mean he isn't a star.
@Shyrxq @Twin_Tower8 @NBA2K Considering I've heard multiple stories of star players getting on their teammates for lack of effort at the pro level and none at the collegiate level this could be false. Also this doesn't apply to everyone but there are nba players who are fine with being role players

A Star is a player who maintains a 25+ Production Per Game in the NBA over his career and plays at least 200 games in the NBA. An NBAer is any player that makes it to 200+ games in the NBA.

@CallMeFishman @PascalMv A bit over simplified of a response.  Was he asking them to say it’s his team while Kyle was on the team?  And did he think it would be someone else’s after Kyle?  He’s the only All Star and All NBA player on the team post Kyle.  Why would it need to be spelled out for him?

@douglas_lee7 @PRGuy17 All caps ‘former?’ Not cool. Former NBA player &amp; former NBA champion (both acceptable intros)—not *quite* an NBA star. That said, Bogues isn’t engaging honestly. He knows what he said &amp; what it meant...it was poorly worded *at best* &amp; even that’s too kind. He’s *been* sh*tposting
@ClassySpeaks 800 to millions = consensus? You need to adjust your definition of overrated so bad because if that’s all it takes then every star in the NBA is overrated
@paytonsticka_43 @Mac__Mac_Mac @DBGyt_ Yeah no. Played the 76rs and got railed first game after playing the nba all star teams out by 40

@BSOLZ_ @LegendOfWinning 2/2: I don’t think good role players can offset an all star or all nba player. Just for the simple fact most role player can be limited via game plan or match up. Hall of fame/ all nba type players most likely are going to be effective regardless.
It must be horrid to be an NBA Star monitored for illegal activity
@VeniceMase the NBA tourney idea would be cool if they made like all star teams out of each division. Maybe even 2 teams per division. Have 12 teams of mini all-star teams with players from their division. Then the winning division gets an award or something.

@FlashBlackmagic @terron_francis @rajonrondos @legendz_nba @TheNBACentral Lmfaoo are we applying bullshit ass caveats to other all stars or just the ones on the bulls? 

People were quick to consider Draymond green a star when the warriors had their run and he was averaging like fuckin 6 and 8, so comedy
@FlashBlackmagic @terron_francis @rajonrondos @legendz_nba @TheNBACentral Dude nobody is saying he is Joel Embiid or Nikola Jokic but Vucevic averages 25 points and 12 rebounds. Dwight Howard averaged 18 and 13 the year he went to the finals. Obviously you have to take defense into account but to not consider Vucevic a star is absurd.
@PlayoffPoole3 @ClippersNets Of course not, why would i think a guy who averaged 15/23/4 and 16/25/5 in his playoff career and who also is an 11x champion, 5x mvp, 12x all star, 11x all nba, 4x rebound champ is better than Curry?
7. Take notes. Write it down.

Kipchoge carries a notebook around, writing what he's learned (especially from books). NBA star @Giannis_An34  does the same thing.

@_wrongera @terron_francis @rajonrondos @legendz_nba @TheNBACentral Lavine and Demar are solid and Vuc made the all star team but who is he guarding, trust no is afraid of him so more like 2 “stars” which 7 seems just right
@_wrongera @terron_francis @rajonrondos @legendz_nba @TheNBACentral Idk which but smart people know draymond was never a star, a good player but not a star, vuc is a nice player, but what did that get the magic, don’t over hype him

@NBA_NewYork @SiriusXMNBA John Wall has been injured for years. Kemba was injured last year and was an all star the year prior.  I don’t think they are even giving it thought.
@Obaticc I don’t think there should be any chances , toning down FULL BARS (cause that’s wat usually droppin) defeats the purpose in my opinion cause in real lyfe star caliber players nba players don’t miss much open shots and that’s how it should be you shouldn’t get penalized for a full

@SheIsTyraB Ben is an elite defender and near elite playmaker.  He was in the running for DPOY.  I struggle to think of one elite NBA skill Wall possesses.   Don’t get me wrong, he’s an above average NBA player but Wall is no all star.  Ben is.
Looking Back on Kevin Durants Career got me thinking like man, where do I rank KD all time?

@BradBallisLife bro all these ppl in the comments. average or not… Kelly is pretty dam good prob not all star good but middle of the pack in the NBA . point is all the dudes in the NBA who will get clowned on or called trash or whatever will easily give anyone buckets on buckets.
Based on just the extension rules, I think Aaron Gordon is really signing for 4/$88M (up to $88.2M) with the same $1M/year in unlikely incentives ($500k All Star, $250k All NBA, $250k All Def) that his current deal has.

@yiswatching @thoughtstuck @bostonplswin Yeah a number 2 pick about to be on his 3rd team in 5 years and will never sniff an All Star game is better than a PG dropping 25 a game attacking the rim. But I’m dense

@G20YT @510J4L @OriginalMalik_ I’m not saying the game is great at all. But if you play like 5 games, go to the daily spin a couple times, and spend your money on the right attributes and your guy is good enough to dominate NBA games on All Star or Superstar or compete against some shitty players at the park.
@HoustonRockets and @JohnWall are reportedly working together to find a new home for the 5x All Star. 

Rockets are clearly rebuilding with young players like Jalen Green, Christian Wood, Kevin Porter Jr., Alperen Sengun and others. Wall doesnt fit those plans. #Rockets #NBA https://t.co/mdJkrSYtjl

@Vikeman1977 @hoopshype Yes, although you highlighted the all star appearances/playoffs for choosing Simmons over Fox. I merely highlighted the fact there are other PGs who neither made an All star or all nba or playoffs last season 2 of which ARE without question better than Simmons.
He’s an okay to good NBA player but let’s stop trying to speak him into being an All Star. It just isn’t happening and that’s okay.

@NBAandCodfan I’d say “good roll player potential”and nothing more. Don’t look for him to be a star. I expect him to struggle his rookie season as he adjusts to the NBA. Look for him to bring defense and effort immediately. His offensive game will need lots of work.

@GuruLakers The NBA media had been ready to crown run and gun since they robbed Kobe of MVP in 05 and 06. They were tired of watching their favorite players getting dunked on and the great white hope Steve Nash was everything they ever wanted.
@RxckzMxxn @19Danieldad @HashMCd @scartonradio @jaycapskiii___ @Anthonysmdoyle @JJMaples55_MST Kind of ridiculous to say Embiid just plays his position well. He's an MVP and defensive player of the year candidate and probably the best Center in the NBA. Simmons does alot on the defensive end nobody doubts that but his half court offense hurts the team as well.
@RxckzMxxn @19Danieldad @HashMCd @scartonradio @jaycapskiii___ @Anthonysmdoyle @JJMaples55_MST Fuck no they aren't neck and neck. Embiid much better offensively, same level on defense, all star starter, all NBA first team, and MVP candidate. Of course he has flaws too like always being out of shape but overall much better player than Ben.
Vaugh Miller being minsiter of environment is like me being MVP of the NBA.
@RyanGarciaESM mike trout was a perennial MVP on below .500 teams and no one questioned it but now all of it sudden it matters? this isn’t the NBA, best case scenario your best hitter only get 1/9th of your team’s total plate appearances. i thought we moved past this line of thinking.
This is the NBA MVP for our time. I love it. https://t.co/BddNub2fOx
@zoyalikesmilfs How can the nba mvp award winner for the past 9 years look bad
@Lure132 @MLBStats @MLB I'm not arguing that he isn't the best, just that with him, the Angels still aren't any better than .500. Where as the Jays would be  .500 without Vald. Lebanon is the best in nba, but doesn't win MVP as an example. Which player has the biggest impact to their team? Vald.
@NBABlackburn Lol the NBA is fuming they had to give this guy the MVP award <U+0001F602>

Nikola Jokic is easily the least hyped up and least talked about MVP in modern NBA history. I wonder why?
CITY MVP/Penthouse

This reward should go across all builds once earned… just like the spawn points… 

This is a great reward and nice for navigating the city but a HUGE L if we need to grind a rap/fashion career, or win an NBA championship will all Myplyers

If lebron doesn’t win MVP this year NBA Is Righed
@meechmeech77 @JShampansky @getnickwright Yea man with Jamal they went to the WCF, Nuggets been a top 3 team for the past 3 years. Jokic been All NBA the past 3 years just won the MVP and was playing like the best team in the league as shown by stats since you don’t watch Nuggets games to use the eye test https://t.co/fUcTZQkrdQ
@RandomAhhJhit @TrevorMartinTho @Yipayo88 @nickadams2_ None of those guys are All NBA except Gobert and id even argue Reggie Jackson has been more help than Conley. Really can’t sit here and say Kawhi is working with the same help. Kawhi wanted PG literally after he came in 3rd for MVP voting lol

@bethanybalcer Typically with end of season awards, leagues don't give money for winning them. However, sponsors often give prizes or money, like Kia giving a car for NBA MVP. Also, contract often include language to address comp related to indv. performance milestones.
@CNBC Do we get articles when the NBA awards are swept by black people?? When is last time NBA had a white MVP??
@murray_center27 @teambieber_yeah must suck being a nuggets fan I'm sorry man. Fraud of an mvp and cant get past best NBA team the sun's.
@JaredBarba3 @murray_center27 must suck being a nuggets fan I'm sorry man. Fraud of an mvp and cant get past best NBA team the sun's.
Rumor on the street is we’re hearing from the reigning NBA MVP today. 

Any questions for Jokic you’re dying to know?
Tyler Herro will be the MVP in the Future he Work hard as Kobe and He is Kind please understand he’s Young just like Kobe few Years early in NBA Peoples must give My Herro few Years
I think @TheTraeYoung gonna win MVP this season plus he will make that first NBA team so he can get his fully guarantee contract #TrueToAtlanta

@naveenganglani @NBA going with doncic for MVP
I'm getting more and more excited for the upcoming @NBA season by the day. There are tons of interesting plots to follow.

Top of my head right now --
who would win MVP?
is the East now better than the West?
are we sleeping on the Warriors as contenders?

how about you? <U+0001F3C0>
Don’t know how you say nobody produces athletes like America.. when the MVP of the NBA is Nigerian <U+0001F62D>
@BPage24 @Jetman2525 @Embiid4MVP @MLB @googlecloud 2 of Mike Trout’s 3 MVPs have come in years the Angels didn’t make the playoffs. It’s not a dealbreaker. This isn’t the NBA where half the league makes the playoffs. Plenty of MLB MVP have come from non-playoff teams. https://t.co/Gi4gvdFEkw
@SnoopDogg  so u can criticize color of Emmy winners but fail to mention that out of the past 30 NBA MVP's only 4 have been white...and then you mention your testicles to Emmy Org.....and still get Corona Beer money....gangster,no way....illumi.....maybe.
@LigmaBa88499020 @RealTonyRose I’ll probably bet a few guys for MVP as the season goes along, I’m fully into NFL atm though I couldn’t care less about the NBA coming back soon tbh lol I’ll care on Christmas and after that

2.Steph Curry

4.Giannis Antetokounmpo 
5.Joel Embid 

*KD only off this list because I feel voters will not show him the love because of Harden &amp; Kyrie- not fair at all. 
@BR_NBA
@_ScottieTheKid @Jetman2525 @Embiid4MVP @MLB @googlecloud Then tell me how Mike Trout doesn’t win every year? You looking at numbers alone? You think Westbrook should be MVP every year in the NBA? Even as a Braves fan I like Bryce and he’s having an insane year, but if they miss the playoffs I don’t see how anyone gets MVP.IMO of course
@dretheoutsider_ @LordMasonx Tell me when a team won 67 games and no one made first team all nba. Tell me when a team won 67 games and no one was top 5 in mvp. That’s all i ask. We punishing everyone after that bullshit

Perhaps One Of The Most Ridiculous Diatribes From A "Serious" Sports Journalist Ever. @spidadmitchell Is Great. But What About @karlmalone #TheMailman...? 
2nd Leading Scorer In @nba History, Two Time NBA C'ship Finalist, &amp; League #MVP https://t.co/4KJkPW5S5r
Same time period, if you told me Jokic would win an MVP before Embiid I wouldn’t have believed you. 

Anyway, are the 76ers the most disappointing NBA team in the 21st century?
@mtascavage @casualtakeking -6 All NBA teams
-4 Top 5 MVP finishes
Outwieghs all of that, not that accolades matter to begin with.
@NBA Why NBA is constantly undermining present MVP????

@HomeDepot420 @MissNaya00 @nightdrive82 @klayphe @StephenCurry30 He never played with another MVP or DPOY. The NBA HOF is overrated Chris Bosh and Tracy McGrady are in All NBA All defensive DPOY MVP scoring champion etc are more telling
@sixandzero23 @nbarealist23 @Scottypippe_n @NBA4Jonathan @bronhistory Paul Pierce was the FMVP when he won his 1 <U+0001F644> now put him with a MVP DPOY 9x All NBA and 12x All defensive player like KG and a historically great shooter like Ray Allen as well as All defensive players Tony Allen and Rajon Rondo LeBron had no All NBAS or All defensive players
@mell0_yt @HoopMixOnly LeBron (obvious) jordan (obvious) Kareem (6 rings 6 mvps 2 finals mvps most points in nba history)  magic (5 rings 3 mvps 3 finals mvp in only 13 season arguable the best playmaker/passer ever) bird (3 championship 2 finals mvp 3 league mvp in less than 13 seasons)
#NBA It's interesting how the NBA never ever feature the reigning MVP in any of their marketing. https://t.co/UMm8drJVyQ
The 76ers were in the second round of the playoffs then blew up a team featuring NBA champion Jrue Holiday and 3 time Champ and Finals MVP Iguodala just to spend 10 years tanking just to get bounced in the 2nd round again. https://t.co/QtUw1GvgtA
The difference is Steph doesnt get attention he gets respect for the way he plays he is an NBA MVP. Ayeesha was asking for “attention” simply because she exists. Know the difference. https://t.co/7KB0uipPHd
@seanduade @topshotfund '94 NBA MVP, DPOY, and Finals MVP is as truth-y as it gets! Tough lil baptism by fire in your case, but agree he'd likely be able to hold his in any era <U+0001F680>
I will bet $1,000,000 THT isn't. Even if I have to work a 9-5 for the next 30 years and make it all up, I know damn well THT ain't dropping 39 in a closing game against the #1 team in the NBA. THT might in the preseason cuz he preseason mvp, but he ain't in playoffs!!!!!!! https://t.co/6PkCsxL3ID
@luka7doncic will win MVP in the 2021-2022 @NBA season <U+0001F624>
@HarrisonWind I love Bones attitude about these pickup games. “They had to split me and (THE MVP OF THE NBA) up because WE were too good” <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602> He might be right! But it sounds funny to say<U+0001F605>
@Jdcostin910 NBA does the best job at marketing it’s players more than it’s teams imo. K tho k it’s also because of how the nba is more of a worldwide brand compared to the NFL which caters to the US and Mexico and London since they play games there.
@GTJxRaptors Both average 27 points per game  rebounds and assists, Bron has more regular season and finals MVP’s, Bron leads the entire NBA playoff history in points . Bron also has a higher career in points <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FE><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F><U+0001F974>
@NBA_taIks 4 finals MVP’s for LeBron vs 2 Kobe . So only 2/5 times kobe was  the most valuable for the championship. The other 3 (in a row I might add ) were shaq . Bron definitely better
@24IamTheGOAT8 All Steph needs is about 2 mvp type seasons hopefully he wins another NBA Championship and he'll enter the top 10 KD is right behind him imo
@J_Smith_711 @NetsKingdomAJ @ClippersNets 1. My bad. I meant Allen not Claxton.
2. Doesn't matter NBA egos don't change w the coach.
3. That's the "right" thing to say &amp; he was rehabbing then. He's healthy now.
4. Makes sense. We'll see.
5. Nash was an NBA MVP. He knows who runs the league.

@NBA Jokic the most disrespected mvp
@NBA Where is the MVP?
@LAClippers @Yg_Trece Pg13 year for regular season mvp and if we get kawhi back an nba championship.
@ben_defender @atomicbombast1c @SportsCenter @wojespn And I think if Ben gets traded without maxey we'll be fine. You start Matisse and depending on who you get back also start maxey. Embiid has been MVP caliber with his PG being 6'10 clogging his paint and making it 4v5 in the half court. We haven't seen prime embiid yet<U+0001F440><U+0001F440>
@XelaPhila @toneyboloney @FrancisGDavis @DerekBodnerNBA Anyways what are your thought on the Ben situation? I'm hoping Matisse starts next season just needs to shoot better. His defense on KD in the Olympics was insane. Also would love the space embiid gets now having a shooting/scoring guard. Almost got MVP with Ben so imagine.
@KamBrothers 

Lakers win the 2021-2022 NBA Championship — which is most likely:

1. AD wins DPOY;
2. Bron has a dominating regular season and wins league MVP;
3. Vogel wins Coach of the Year;
4. Pelinka wins Executive of the Year;
5. Nothing. Lakers get snubbed by league voting.

I’m writing a sci-fi novel. It’s about a self-centered NBA player that can’t shoot, but thinks he’s an MVP. He refuses to honor his contract and sits out.  One day he gets abducted by aliens who perform experiments. They return him to earth where he still sucks.  I need a title.

Kicking off the top 40 in my countdown of the #top100 #nba players of all time with John Havlicek, who won 8 titles with @celtics, including a Finals MVP in 1974, and he would have won it in 1968 if it had existed. He is also Boston's all time top scorer.https://t.co/LK6SLaOeyr
@Sixers_Matt Must have been difficult being "unnecessarily patient" w/ a 25 year old player who is a 3 time all star, has a 3rd team all nba, 2 straight all D teams, was runner up in DPOY and got mvp votes this year, top 20 in D win shares 4 straight seasons, top 20 in fg % 4 times etc etc <U+0001F602>
@jobachamberlin1 @LakerCentral365 Who’s being naive now <U+0001F923>. NBA absolutely does step in to preserve its product. A sixers team with an mvp candidate in Embiid is a financial jackpot and they will mediate. Do some research.  Rockets got some great rebuilding pieces for a guy that limped thorough the second round.
@FanMahome Harden in 2017 had one of the biggest Star collapse in nba history. After underperforming every playoffs, In do or die game 6 of 2017 WC semifinals, he took 11 shots total(2 inside 3 pt) for 10 points &amp; 6 TOs. That year he was 2nd in mvp vote. Did Rockets toss him under the bus?
@Okrob_ @KimoLbj @Ballislife How many scoring titles, mvp titles, finals mvp titles, all defensive NBA and so on does your 5th greatest player of all time have? Lebron is great but he's not even above Kobe. Lebron isn't even top 4. Come on, kid.

@marvgoated @SulloReport @hakimbristel22 @Original_Gio They had a winning record with him fool. They lost earlier in the playoffs cause they played the team with the best record in the NBA and the MVP -bucks-   Why are you continuing to be this ignorant ? The Celtics were not loaded. They were good with Kyrie.
@chuckguarantees @marvgoated @SulloReport @hakimbristel22 @Original_Gio What was the point in your tweet ? Did you just want to say something that contributes nothing ? The bucks had the best record in the NBA and the MVP. The Cavs did not. Add something more insightful to the conversation next time
@NYKfan10304 @STUDYTHEGOAT @ClippersNets You think based on what? Embid just lost to the hawks in the 2nd round. At least when Kyrie lost in the 2nd round to the bucks, the bucks had the best record in the NBA and MVP and Kyrie was the only allstar on the Celtics that year. So you think based on what?
@marvgoated @SulloReport @hakimbristel22 @Original_Gio They looked worst with him based on what?  Did the Celtics play the bucks when they had the best record in the NBA and the MVP in the playoffs with or without Kyrie ? If they didn't play them with and without Kyrie , then why are you comparing when they didn't play the same team https://t.co/zefbdJBYK1

@JustEsBaraheni @Travis_Sawchik @theScore In the NBA, the unofficial rule was that your team had to win at least 50 games. That's how Steve Nash on the Suns beat out Kobe and Shaq those years. 

But then Westbrook was named MVP, although OKC won &lt;50 games. Otani can be considered the MLB equivalent of the trip-dub king.

@CarmichaelDave I expect nothing less than Magic's rookie season out of Mitchell. 

Based on Kings twitter, if Mitchell isn't the NBA finals MVP then I will be disappointed.
@BlackedOut__ I remember Russ got that tripledouble mvp as the 6th seed .After that idk fr but you know the NBA like to push narratives like if ben Simmons was to come out next year play his sme game but got a 12-15 footer shooting abt 41fG &amp; 70FT and HOU make the play-in .he might steal a mvp

@CantGuardCurry @WJ3PICK6 @BullsGotNext "The National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) is an annual National Basketball Association (NBA) award given since the 1955–56 season to the best performing player of the regular season. The player with the highest point total wins the award."
@SlamCentralNYY @SkipBay23 @NBA LeBron got MVP and a ring and finals MVP and all nba 1st team and all defensive 1st team in a season while having 26.8ppg, 8 rebounds per game, 7.3 assist per game , and he played 76 games  (2012-2013)
@Str8Buckets_ @MinusAllFilters @wojespn bottom line is he had 4 years to get a jumpshot and with the best help in the nba he failed to do so. which wasted a mvp year from joel
@CobyValentine Reminds of Kobe having a better season and the nba giving Nash his second mvp instead. Hopefully vladdy get it this year. That boy is a beast.

This article is for those that like an odd wager here or there, notable odds for the Raptors:

Winning the championship: $100 pays $8000

Barnes to win ROTY $100 pays $1200

Siakam winning MVP $100 pays $15000

What do they know.

https://t.co/yoAgVSrNQf
In one of our closest polls ever, 51% of people agree that Siakam would not be named MVP even if he averages 26/9/6 and we make the playoffs.  Thanks everyone for participating!

That's what you call progression.  The best is yet to come, Siakam says his goal is to win the MVP award.  It's easy to see why he believes he can.

@HanaHoops Trae Young 2021 NBA mvp
It’s interesting that the NBA’s Red Auerbach Coach of the Year trophy &amp; Bill Russell Finals MVP trophy honor a Celtic duo that were synonymous with winning. Russell won 11 NBA titles in 13 years, including 2 as player-coach. Both men had a huge impact on the NBA’s early success.
@FullTimeHoops1 Baron Davis and a young Derrick Rose were also explosive NBA players who could dunk over taller dudes. Davis, who played for UCLA in college, had a very solid NBA career. Rose, who played in college at Memphis, was named NBA MVP at age 22. Injuries have hampered his pro career.
@SteveCelts @WitMiBBall @dphilton @AndrewDBailey @JaMorant So you’re a casual if you think that a singular dunk is worth an MVP nod. I get it. You’re new to this. 

I appreciate Ja Morant, don’t get it twisted. But he’s not remotely close to the top dogs in the NBA.
@atrupar I "may be" the NBA and NFL and MLB MVP.

Ben Simmons is an all nba/ mvp caliber talent 

You’re not getting anything close to Simmons for Wall

Ben can shoot and move without the ball and there’s plenty of workout film to prove it
@JJGotitt @LostxSawce @nba_paint @TheRealJRSmith Oh nah you get city points to get “city mvp” to get the penthouse. I just didn’t know it was the penthouse lol thanks.
@Mvnkey_YT @LostxSawce @nba_paint @TheRealJRSmith you have to win mvp or sum like that and you get a penthouse

https://t.co/kEHoYLXIkL
@Stephen0610 @NBA I think they should add a playoff MVP (different from finals MVP) too. I'm sure there'd be seasons it's the same player but I think it'd go a long way towards recognizing who actually is the best player in the league in a given season
@darvon4554 @MagicJohnson @KingJames The most points per game in NBA history. Only player to win MVP, Defensive player of the year in the same year. Most points per game in NBA finals
@jay_pea619 @___Colb___ @TROTWAM It’s the nba voters, it’s the way they cover him that won’t even make him win the mvp, the voters are so obsessed over Giannis, Jokic, Joel, KD, Luka, N Steph they are obsessed wit who those players should win it
Two awards I would like to see the @NBA add to the regular season awards are the following.

•Offensive player of the year
•Biggest comeback player of the year

I think those would be great while balancing how we look at other awards like most improved and MVP.
Don’t matter what team you trade Ben Simmons to because the day he decides to be the player you see in those pick up games in 82 games HE TRANSFORMING ANY FRANCHISE! You crazy if you don’t know that, that team instantly got a MVP candidate! @NBA @sixers @BenSimmons25 @KingJames
Just for context Bill Russell won 5 league MVP's and 11 NBA championships https://t.co/ZkBOlT4iDb
@WalkWithLyle Allen Iverson demanded a trade too. Nothing happened he came back won All star MVP NBA MVP lead the league in scoring and took the team to the finals with 6 injuries including a broken tailbone
Is the voting for NBA MVP racist? #EmmySoWhite
In his 2nd season (2019-2020) Luka was already one of the best NBA players in the league. He made his 1st all-star game, was already in MVP conversations and led his team to the playoffs. He averaged:
28.8 ppg

@canadiankidDJE I seen the glow up with my own eyes I’m literally in awe how good this man is …not everyone path is league but after a couple chips and Euro Mvp I want him in Nba even 1 season.
@chicagobulls That's that MVP focus. Yup, @ZachLaVine is putting the entire @NBA on notice. And we love to see it. LET'S GO!!!!! #BullsNation https://t.co/S5hF2gdR5s
@Lucas55717957 @JL_34Celtz @NBAMemes He was the NBA D-League MVP, and won a ring in 2005. <U+0001F5FF>
@cuteassnigga @TyStayBrezzy @Chaoticday1 @RobKSports @statmuse @Giannis_An34 @DR34M @Bucks They aren’t. And neither are accolades. Many of the things u listed (MVP, NBA champion) rely a lot on team success whether people wanna admit it or not
@MagicJohnson Nice. 

Bill Russell: 11 NBA titles in 13 years, including 8 in a row. 2 NCAA championships. 5-time MVP. NBA champion as player/coach. 12-time All Star.

Joe Johnson, aka “Iso Joe,” is coming off another phenomenal season in entertainment mogul Ice Cube’s Big 3 league, winning league MVP for the second time. Will somebody give the 7-time All-Star a shot at age 40?

NBA rankings drop tomorrow. KD or Giannis should be no. 1. Long as he’s healthy, Durant should be in the MVP race all year.
Ay yo @Flight23White stop being a simp for curry. Every video you act like a curry fan girl. I hope you know his parents are divorced and curry is not the best point guard in the league. It has to be Derrick rose. Was curry the youngest mvp in nba history? No so stop it flight.

@MylesTW So awards should be based on color, not performance? Good to know.  Will be waiting for the next white NBA MVP, then Latino, then Asian, don't leave out Native Americans, or people from India, and of course a Gay Man.  Sounds ridiculous, but that's what race baiters do.

@Arrie33IBA @AmNotEvan Yeah. John Wall has one of the worst contracts in the NBA and his knees are made of Nature Valley Bars. This makes zero sense for a team trying to compete with an MVP level big man with his own injury concerns.

@KhepryRe @SportsCenter @ESPNNBA And is still a 7x all star, an all star MVP, a Rookie of The Year, an olympic gold medalist, and a World Cup champion, a World Cup MVP, and an NBA Champion. So imagine if he didn’t miss the 200 games

@Bonvivant1979 @LevitatingWolf @jrichardgoodman Agreed, 100%.  I've always thought the NBA should have a postseason MVP instead of a Finals MVP.  Kobe dominated the Kings and Spurs that year.
After winning another BIG3 MVP, Joe Johnson says he’s keeping the door open for a return to the NBA.

@N_200_zz @chicagobulls @SamSmithHoops Well i disagree, because he was much better in europe as teen and main guy. Luka is next mvp but in europe he got it bcause Real wanted to cash him in nba. He wasnt best in final four or in regular season. He was 3 best in ff and 4/5 best in regular season, Toni was dominant mvp
@rjdisidoro Nash is a true point guard because he could've scored way more than he did after the hand checking ban in 2004.  But Phoenix had so many scorers around him that he didn't need to score much.  He remains the lowest scoring MVP since Wes Unseld in 1969.

https://t.co/6oDG3JzOnG
No, you said old Kareem would close out the '90s Bulls in 6 or 7 games. That just isn't true. 

I watched the late '80s NBA playoffs LIVE. Kareem was still a solid contributor, but not MVP level like 1985.

Divac in 1991 was more productive. Kareem was just too old at that point. https://t.co/zSuRwtG3Ba https://t.co/TGdrAEARiZ
@twitchejnave What?  No those are not the same thing. Lebron James is the best player in the NBA and yet not the MVP for years....
@jimdangle69 @OHB_lawren @JuJu_3xx @ClippersNets Not only is top 15 not an actual candidate but it’s written by some random dude who works for https://t.co/eh2GOBXbpx. It’s 1 opinion who says kyrie isn’t even a top 10 candidate. Is Julius MVP caliber? Rudy?  No and they’re both above Kyrie on both of the lists he showed.
@IGGYPOPS07 @Emzhiii @24IamTheGOAT8 I love people saying that the plumbers of the 90s wouldn't keep up with the athletic freaks of the modern NBA. Meanwhile in the modern NBA, the current MVP is literally a slow, unathletic, non-physical white dude.

Lamar Jackson is to the NFL what Giannis was to the NBA six months ago. He won an MVP at a young age but he gets trashed on Twitter because he hasn’t won a championship and his play style isn’t conventional.
@J03LJ3 Hardaway made two all star teams with the Heat… and three all NBA teams with the Heat… he also earned MVP votes (he came in 4th) with the Heat… There is no comparison… at all. Go find a new slant.
@MrChuckD @DaveWinfieldHOF Drafted in 3 sports by 4 major league teams (MLB, NFL, NBA, and ABA), was the best hitter, ace pitcher, and CWS MVP on his college team, and never spent a single day in the minor leagues.
@jimdangle69 @ClippersNets @NetsHomeBr @D4DcRIES @rhynopig87 That is where I and most nba players and analysts would disagree. Kyrie for sure has the talent and ability to be a MVP. It more so his window has passed then anything else
@staminokabass1 @jedeyeee @mx439 @TheWarriorsTalk 50/40/90 while averagjng 27/6/4 all time historic numbers. Multiple time all nba multiple time all star. All star mvp. 3pt shooting champ. Midrange leader. Greatest handle of all time. Greatest finnisher among the small of all time. Top 5 most skilled players of all time.
@johnnybezgood I love this concept of “lebron dominates nba”. He played 18 seasons so far, won 4 championships (22%) and one scoring title (5%). Also he made even Andre Iguodala a finals mvp, so dominating he is
@YouDontKnowISH_ @plasticono215 @TheNBACentral Shaq is a buffoon &amp; hater.
Jokic is the current MVP and ZERO weaknesses. 

Shaq lazy ass cost lakers additional  titles w Kobe. 2004 NBA finals was embarrassing ending for lakers.

@NBA @nbatopshot Defensive player of the year, finals mvp. Giannis
@JuJu_3xx @ClippersNets You either need to have a historic offensive year as a clear #1 on a contender, or be an all nba caliber player on both sides of the ball and be the #1 option on a contending team to be a real MVP threat. Look at the dudes who win it man. Kyrie is not on their level.
Was Kobe Bryant's MVP season his best season in the NBA?
NBA Twitter Reacts To Zion Willamson Winning 2024 MVP : https://t.co/G2QBUtoTRx
A more obscure example is Chauncey Billups and Allen Iverson. Billups scored 15 points per game during his career while Iverson averaged 26 points per game during his career. He also won the NBA MVP and made 7 All-NBA teams.  Clearly Iverson was the better individual player. https://t.co/rPgSj4Boll
However, Chauncey Billups won the NBA championship &amp; Finals MVP, in 2004. Iverson never won these accolades. When he and Billups were traded for one another, something interesting happened. Billups led the Denver Nuggets to the Conference Finals, something Iverson failed to do. https://t.co/seAoJWpwYR

@Drazah__ MLB is probably doing the mvp award right. NBA NFL definitely have narratives and team record as a factor
@NoahL_14 @firejudgepls It’s not just about sacks I fully get it but sweat is also top 5 in impact which like they say in the nba if u got 2 mvp candidates they cancel. Young is good but he’s not what I’m hearing.
@KCinCypress62 Matt Ryan is Romo with an MVP and Super Bowl appearance that sounds about right
And lastly?
 Because bookies wreck me today 
I no win !!  

Who is the MVP of the NBA 2021?
First to answer correctly and you must retweet!!!
@Raptors36557179 @bamaddamayo @TheNBACentral no doubt - peak Shaq was already the best player in the NBA for a time (won an MVP in 2000 so that’s one season right there without the rules of today’s game )

@WrayXin @Harrison_Grimm @PompeyOnSixers In which of those areas is LeBron better than Magic fucking Johnson?

Dude was a two-time MVP and a Finals MVP by age 22 in a solid, star-filled era of the NBA.
I travelled all the way to NOLA in 2017 to watch the NBA all star finals I.e to see AD <U+0001F602>. He got MVP and I was so hyped <U+0001F97A>. He was with the Pelicans at the time.

@BobMonr14690301 @urkle9 Here comes the non objective shit. Just Bron hate, Curry Stan. 

Curry isn’t bad. But nothing about 16-17 would make him the mvp or 1st team all nba. He was a “candidate” but the guys who got it, clearly earned it.
@ClutchPointsApp @MagicJohnson @StephenCurry30 @IsiahThomas Magic 13 season.       Curry 12 season 
5 chips                         3 chips
3 MVP's.                      2 MVP's 
3 FMVP's.                    0 FMVP's 
12 allstar.                      7 allstar            
10 all nba.                     7 all nba

Magic best pg alltime
@wcruben1 @TheWarriorsTalk I feel Alltime great needs to have chips MVP's FMVP's reg stats playoff stats playoff appearance  all nba all defense allstars ect stats are part of the individual part of his career how great he was thru out his career
@shawndawndada @Jakewantsanap @TheWarriorsTalk Top 15-20 I agree for me an alltime great is a top 10 player alltime one who has reg stats playoff stats playoff appearance  MVP's FMVP's chips allstars all nba all defense ect
@DaddySports @mrtomeoni Robert Covington is the most underrated player in the NBA. He is the perfect modern NBA player. If you don't agree with me, then your a casual who was impressed by Russel Westbrook's stat padding MVP year. Ya sheep
@BadNBATakes_ @legoatkawhifan @acidmindmelt Kareem has like 4 more mvp level seasons and 6 more seasons of at least all nba. You can’t act like that’s nothing
@BadNBATakes_ @acidmindmelt @legoatkawhifan I don’t care about chips when evaluating players. I care about the actual career value. And I do it so the peak years are worth more so I do value peak a lot. But like I said when u have 4 more mvp level years and 6 more all nba level years, it makes it close even with peak gap

@Jepte02196690 @newlyalex @JavonteVaeza I'll take LeBron James who's won an MVP in the NBA finals and a world championship in 2020 over the low bar your setting for Luka who wasn't even in the top 3 in MVP voting he was 6th. So following your MVP voting logic CP3  is it better than luka who finished 6th <U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F> C'mon <U+0001F923>
@GuitaristJT @newlyalex @JavonteVaeza So far you've tried equate the Luka low bar first round lost lac to a LeBron NBA Championship win.

Try to equate the Luka low bar finishing 6th in NBA MVP voting to a player who's actually won the MVP and the championship MVP. C'mon <U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F><U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F><U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>
@Jepte02196690 @newlyalex @JavonteVaeza That's correct I'll take LeBron a proven winner right now who won the finals MVP and NBA championship in 20 who was leading his team to another championship in 21 before injury over low bar Luka who was 6th in MVP results &amp; can't get the Mavs out of the 1st rd of the playoffs<U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>
@chanfeathers @newlyalex @JavonteVaeza When your talking about right now LeBron who was supposed to make it to the NBA finals but got hurt who has 4 NBA championships being less than Luka who can't get his team out of the 1st rd of the playoffs while bypassing Giannis who won the MVP and the NBA Championship <U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F><U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F><U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>

@NicoleMcMilllon @CoachQues Damn you’d think by the way you talk about him that he wouldn’t even be an NBA player. Much less a 4x champion, 4x FMVP, 4x MVP, most All NBA 1st Teams ever, most all nba ever, on the verge of most all star ever, a scoring and assist champ, with countless other records
@Dpress123 @theScore I think a better way of describing this potential farce of an MVP win for Ohtani is that MLB is going the ways of NBA with narrative based voting for the year end awards rather than by actual stats

People hype up Ohtani's pitching but as the stats stand, he wouldn't win Cy Young

@twolveswave <U+0001F64B> if you are admitting you assumed "The Most Spectacular Player" award meant MVP but actually had no idea that it didn't. Now you looked it up for the first time and try to side step that part by throwing an example of a player who also didn't reach their NBA expectations. . .
There hasn't been a lot of Celtics news of late, which gave me the perfect opportunity to make my bold prediction: Jayson Tatum will be in the NBA MVP mix this upcoming season. For @ForbesSports

It is amazing that people claim the big man doesnt matter in todays nba. Yet Jokic is MVP, Embiid likely beats out Jokic if he stays healthy. The Hawks turn around was due to Capela playing more mins. AD and Giannis closed games at the 5 for the last 2 champs at 6ft 11.
Maybe i'll get the mvp of The NBA celebrity game

@JackIsCo0ol @ClutchPointsApp @MagicJohnson @StephenCurry30 @IsiahThomas Nowhere close? You're saying this like Magic averaged 34 and 14 or something??? Magic got an advantage in MVP's and FMVP's fir sure, but he absolutely had the best team in the NBA for almost a decade. Nobody cared about superteam's back then either like now.

@LeGoat03824702 @BleacherReport @KingJames @russwest44 averaged a 20ppg+ triple double while leading the league in career high 11asp  and top 6 in the nba  with career high 11 rpg. Leading a  average team to the playoffs while finishing top 10 in MVP voting and winning 1x player of the month. But slightly average ?
Random hot takes for this NBA season:

Jayson Tatum will win MVP

This will be the last year of prime James Harden

Westbrook and Lebron will be the first players to both average triple doubles on the same team.

Suns won’t make the playoffs

@Marquis81525836 @PBS I agree 100%!You nailed it! He won 3 State Championships,3Ncaa Championships,and 6 NBA Championships! Facts! Plus he also has 6 Mvp's!
ESPN reporting: The NBA has fined reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo $10,000 for his comments during postgame interview, per sources.
ESPN reporting: The NBA has fined Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard $10,000 for his comments during postgame interview, league sources tell ESPN.
@NuggetsNationCP As a fan of the Nuggets, I would enjoy another MVP season for Joker. 

As a fan of the Nikola Jokic: I know that he doesn't care about his stats or winning another MVP. He already earned the MVP.
He would rather earn the NBA Championship.

@CBandz25 @CroixBoy @JCrossover @Ballislife Yeah but considering he lead 96 bulls to 72 wins, was the MVP, Was 1st in Win shares, Was 6th in DPOY voting, Won a scoring champion, was 1st team all nba, was first team all defense, Averaged 30.7 in the playoffs, Won the champion and FMVP. I’d say that was the best guard Season
@DimeDropperPod @cedricmaxwell81 Many forget he was 1979 NBA Finals MVP
@OkayButNo5 @FadeawayWorld Go back and look at the mvp ladder around March on https://t.co/IQxoj7mifN and then tlk to me. Not top 10 smh
@dhwanisaraiya_ Tough one tbh, former MVP who’s had a recent resurgence, idk any NBA players like that
NBA always be on weird shit ..not giving the MVP a Christmas game?? I remember when they were giving the Knicks nationally televised games cuz Jeremy Lin had his moment
My predictions for The 2022 NBA Season and I got the Clippers and the Bucks in the 2022 NBA Finals And the Clippers winning the series in 7 games and Kawai Leonard winning the Finals MVP and DONT SAY I'M STUPID BECAUSE I'LL FUCKING GO CRAZY ON YOUR ASS BITCH
@AG_NBA_ @Captain589Price Tatum MVP and Celtics championship is def. in the realm of possibilities. Id place some bets on it
@amnrell @cairo_in_orbit @kingmos63322010 @Derrick_MSU_106 That’s cap. Malone is a 14x all star 2x MVP 5x All nba. Stockton is a 10-11 time all nba assist leader all star 5x all defensive steal leaders.  Bruh. They aren’t brought up in the goat convo, but they damn sure are among the best players in the league.

It’s interesting that in the NBA amount of games and being injury prone is absolutely a major factor in MVP race negating MVP winners (see #Embiid). But in the MLB  the fans &amp; voters almost completely discount Harper’s game count &amp; battle through his ailments v. Tatis. #Phillies
These guys are saying that missed games favors the player in the @MLB MVP race??? While the @NBA is all against missed games for MVP.
Only Players to Win McDonald’s All American Game MVP and an NBA MVP:

@GreenRolland @ya_hush @AMAZINIZDAVE @DwitjustinGilas @Ballislife of course he doesn't but he's a center that won the MVP award, Embiid also was in the race

The Dream was much more complete than both guys but centers still can win the hardware in today's NBA.

@Phllee8194Lee @jrichardgoodman Malone bw ‘79-83, 3 MVP’s and a Chip. 4 1st team all nba teams.  He was dominant at his peak
one day you will be able to vote for the #NBA mvp by staking a moment as a vote

if the player you voted for wins, you will get priority access to an mvp pack with moments from that player’s mvp season
The most underrated player in #NBA history is Moses Malone, feels like a wide margin to me as he isn’t mentioned at all. Peak, MVP consistency, best offensive rebounder in league history and routinely dominated Kareem.

Or stanning all nba and mvp awards that are given by a majority yt voting block

All i ask is you frame this tweet when its obvious who the more reliable player at the highest level is
@BillSimmons I genuinely wonder what percent of the voting block are white people.

It doesnt sit right with me that a majority white vote continues to gatekeep who our black legends are. Whether it be MVP, ALL NBA or #NBA75 

Kyrie, Iverson and TMac all better be on this list

@sambaer1960 @ProvideContext Agree.  Kareem was the GOAT of his generation.  3 NCAA Titles and 3 College Player of the Year, 6 NBA Championships, 6 NBA MVP’s, All time leading scorer…. Lebron is the GOAT of his generation.
@GCLLEYT @JahGoated How? Giannis already has more MVP’s than all 3 combined. 1 DPOY away from tying Kawhi. He’s obviously going to get more All NBA and All Defense teams as he is only 26.
@NBAMemes So, MVP candidates would have to play on bad teams. Then, gun their way to MVP on said teams that will never beat a complete with teams full of competent NBA players?
Giannis in 2020-21:

All-Star
All-Star Game MVP
All NBA First Team
First Team All Defense

@imcuriousaboutt @SlimSleepr Curry fouling out for no reason in game 6
They were at least 3 if not 4 fouls that would not have been called on any MVP in NBA Finals history that would've been 4 more possesions for them in game 6 + Curry still playing in the 4th quarter
@TheBigTicketx5 quest and just playing nba games, get a lot of mvp points that way..

Let's say A certain NBA player like performs at a weak MVP level since his second year and continuously plays for very poor teams for like 11 years , has a serious injury and retires. How high would you rank him ?
@wheatonbrando “NBA Champion, Finals MVP and 3x MVP Moses Malone”.
In 1967-68, Larry Brown was an ABA all-star, the all-star game MVP, 2nd team All-ABA, 6th in MVP balloting and his team won the ABA title.  

Has any NBA player ever achieved those things in one year?  You’d think Magic.  The tricky one is AS game MVP b/c that is a crapshoot.

Just watch when they get the nba going more in Africa 

You will see Joel embiid and other like him on 2k covers and winning mvp

Same thing with Giannis https://t.co/GR3xuBflX9

Dennis Johnson was born on this day in 1954.

During his retirement ceremony, Magic Johnson lauded him as "the best backcourt defender of all-time".

Larry Bird called Johnson the best teammate he ever had.

1979 NBA Finals MVP.

3x NBA Champion.

No. 3 retired by Celtics.

@lsn92620 @957thegame +there’s nothing wrong w/a team w/cap space signing FA’s<U+0001F602>
GSW needed inside scoring(Millsap wouldve worked too), had their own FA SF up for a max, had cap room bc their MVP had bad ankles when he signed his deal+NBA bumped the cap.
If YOU had $26m to spend: Use it on HB or KD?<U+0001F476>
@RealSkipBayless @undisputed On just being a scorer? There were better scorers than KD in NBA history like Ice Man Gervin and Bernard King to name a few we never thought they were MVP’s. What is the criteria for an MVP anyway? This award has lost its luster. A guy that can’t even defend his lunch is MVP.

@Mali2Slimeyyy @LegendOfWinning And then went on to beat his team en route to an NBA title and Finals MVP. So again I say, who cares?
@1234_abcdef1234 6 time MVP, 6-time champ. Just dominant for 2 decades. NBA all-time leading scorer.
@bt_ramy I don’t see the NBA giving the mvp to anyone on the lakers or nets this year because of how good their rosters are. But I could be wrong.
@William34709703 @WkndatBurnies @cubans6767 @BleacherReport @breakfastclubam Who here said Kyrie over bron for fmvp? 
Kyrie honestly doesn’t get enough credit most of the time tho, he was 24 years old on the biggest stage in the NBA dropping 40pt games and breaking ankles of the unanimous MVP and sinking championship winning buckets. Man was a beast.

The mvp standard so different in each sport. NFL it’s jus damn near best QB, NBA u gotta have numbers and b a top seed, MLB jus numbers, half the time mvp don’t make the playoffs lol

I think Ohtani winning MVP will ultimately turn into the Westbrook triple double convo. RW wins nba mvp bc he averaged trip double. Ohtani wins mvp bc of combo of pitching and hitting. Ohtani will most likely continue this every year. What will the future narrative be? @PaulHembo

The scenario of the shot is epic. Imagine getting guarded by the Unanimous MVP, playing against the team with the best record in NBA HISTORY, you were already down 3-1, and now it’s game 7. After the best block in NBA finals history. Step back, splash. Cold.

@allph_1111 Exactly it’s a star driven league meaning jo finishing second in MVP voting is far more impressive than Bryce winning finishing second this year.Way more good players in the nba.I agree a single player can have more of an impact in the nba but ur team being decent is important
Wilt Chamberlain was present in the 1967 NBA Finals and someone else scored 40 PPG in the series, not him.

That Rick Barry knew how to chuck.

Anyways, Chamberlain gets the Finals MVP, since he was the best player in the series: https://t.co/ex0HZJcUbW
Wilt Chamberlain gets in on the Lost Finals MVP action as his 76ers capture the 1967 NBA title.

https://t.co/ex0HZJcUbW
By the way, only one more Lost Finals MVP left to award: 1968.

The NBA started giving out the real deal in 1969.
In the 1966 NBA Finals, Bill Russell averaged a cool 24 PPG and 24 RPG to once again earn a Lost Finals MVP.

Over the last three season, Giannis won...
2018-19: MVP
2019-20: MVP, DPOY
2020-21: Finals MVP

Over the course of that span, he had a Box Plus-Minus of +10.2

The only two players in NBA history with a better BPM over any three-year span are Michael Jordan and LeBron James.
@BoatzNHoesPT1 @Kingb4l @SOLEKING734 @JaythaBurner @24IamTheGOAT8 I remember reigning MVP Derrick Rose saying in a press conference in the ECF about LeBron.... 'I mean it's hard to score against someone who's bigger, faster and plays D like that.' The premier PG in the NBA at that time talking about a guy with a PF frame being faster lol

@Tony79987947 @Str82DaLeague @ClutchPointsApp @blakegriffin23 @KingJames Pippen was an awesome player,  yall lucky chicago fooled him somehow with 15 million for 7 years.  1st all nba team, consistent top 10 mvp once top 3, all star mvp, 1st all nba defensive, steals leader. He got more personal accolades than so called superstars like kyire or pg
@theScore I preferred a time when I didn’t know who owned a team. Ballmer drives me a little crazy. His team is only relevant now because a two time NBA finals MVP wanted to play at home and not with LBJ.
Dude imagine if Ja Morant led his team to the best record in the entire NBA and won the MVP this year. In only his 3rd season. Wouldn’t that be NUTS!?!?!
Imagine the NBA giving the MVP award to Jokic oh wait they did <U+0001F644>
@La_Shone_ @ChxseShe @dubnation50 @Zain__Daniel @FTFonFS1 @Chris_Broussard Oh I had no idea kyrie was a 2x mvp, first unanimous MVP ever, 3x champ, 2x scoring champ, 4x all nba 1st team.

Wym kyrie don’t need a system? What has he ever done without one?
Let’s have some fun… tell me some predictions for the upcoming NBA season, MVP , Most improved etc Not far away now <U+0001F60D> #nba #NBATopShot #series3
@RealSkipBayless @undisputed He's going to be what 37? And he's still in top 10 contention for MVP lmao, obviously this man is still uncontested as best player in the NBA until further notice. Only injury can stop him from a finals trip at this point in his career.

According to sources @JoelEmbiid  is serious about competing to win the dpoy , and or mvp this season. Expect him to come out of the gate swinging this season. @sixers @wojespn @ShamsCharania @JoelEmbiid #nbanews #nba #Philadelphia76ers #basketball #basketballnews
@OTownNBA @ZoToLaVine @MeIoWRLD More people on twitter say D-Rose didn't deserve his MVP than say Drose is one of the greatest players ever. I understand that a lot of NBA twitter didn't get to see MVP rose but calling him overrated is disingenuous

@nbaking44 @Amaripop @ClutchPointsApp @blakegriffin23 @KingJames Like in 95 when Jordan joined first team all nba/3rd in mvp voting Scottie pippen and added an all-time great in Dennis Rodman?
@BarcaPlsFkinWin i agree his production is there, but not playing in a nba finals or winning mvp, and having been in a small market his whole career he probably doesn’t get talked about enough to withstand the test of time
@BadNBATakes_ @24IamTheGOAT8 You act like LeBron wasn’t a Finals MVP in 2020 and MVP runaway before his injury in 2021... Oh and 3-1 first time ever in NBA History in 2016.. https://t.co/5tmSCtTjiR

@mpolites09 @DannyVietti Does the best offensive player ALWAYS win MVP in the NBA?  Absolutely not.  And that’s where every player plays on both sides of the ball.  This is something far more clear cut for the comparison of having to be the best being irrelevant.
@Bouttacheck1 @NumbersLie_ @ClutchPointsApp @blakegriffin23 @KingJames Wade was 1st team all nba in 2009, a top candidate for mvp as well. What are you talking about?
@Amaripop @Scott67628952 @yrgkingK @ClutchPointsApp @blakegriffin23 @KingJames Lies, 2014 he was easily top 10, 2nd  team all nba. He was 4th in ppg only behind melo, Durant and bron, and he was 3rd in rebounding. He was an absolute beast with mvp shares
@24IamTheGOAT8 Wade was already a superstar with one NBA championship and a final MVP when LeBron joined him ...Pippen on the other Hand was just a Rookie with no experience that matured under Jordan and Phil leadership to become who he was on a Basketball court .2 different situations carry on
@KramerTheLab @mark_dow @RexChapman @kaj33 @BillSimmons @espn Touche....still, I wonder how/if Simmons would update the pyramid now. And have you *ever* seen a list where Kareem is #1 despite:

This is hilarious. Jokic was deserving f the MVP, just like the Bucks were deserving of the championship, however if it wasn’t for the most injury plagued season in NBA history BY FAR he wouldn’t be MVP.

Beside the two rings that KD won by joining a 73-9 Warriors team that was already great, what major achievements does he have over Westbrook? Westbrook has 1 regular season MVP,so does KD, Westbrook has the most triple double in the history of the NBA;KD is nowhere close to that.

@chizmoe1 @whatDeFault @Mavs_FFL I get peoples arguments against him. But two all nba first teams. And two times top 5 in mvp voting to me makes him a top 5 player. I get he’s not the greatest free throw shooter. But neither is lebron. Or giannis. And he did get bounced by the clippers.
@TKormac So you wouldnt want your kid learning about how to workout from a former NBA MVP? But you send him to your local trainer for $50 and say "listen up"?
What would you say if I told you @jaytatum0 will win the NBA MVP this year and attract his best friend @RealDealBeal23 to the @celtics
@BronGotGame @OVOLakeShow @ESPNNBA @KendrickPerkins the way that lebron fans put down his all nba teammates to raise lebron up has always been disgusting bro. they the type to say KD plays alongside league MVPs but wont even acknowledge that even tho wade never got an MVP he was always that caliber and in the mix
@WstCoast_Johnny @TheLakersReview Magic &amp; Kareem &amp; Kobe @ Shaq were 4 of the top 10 players in NBA history. James Worthy was a #1 draft pick &amp; Hall of Famer. Mychal Thompson was a #1 draft pick. McAdoo was an MVP, #2 pick, Hall of Famer. Gasol 6x All -Star, lock HOF.

Let's say he's done being an nba all star, a reasonable assumption, but hypothetically goes to a top euro league for 7 years and wins an mvp or two, he's a lock right?

It’s so crazy that Derrick rose injury bug changed the nba.. it would be crazy if you just had him running crazy in curry, bron, durant and kawhis prime. Plus who would of gone to Chicago or if he ever decided to leave playing at that level. Just another mvp floating about
Can’t believe the young Knick guards have the luxury to learn the game from the former youngest MVP ever in Derrick Rose and a NCAAA Champ / multiple time NBA All Star in Kemba Walker.
@NBA He would have been the Finals MVP if the Pistons had beaten the Spurs in 2005.
@Ulik23 @therealselena23 @isiah_nba @TheNBACentral I didn’t forget mans had that pelicans team on his back n he stepped up big in the finals run.But what joel just did this last season being a runner up mvp candidate,undergoing injuries n still playing through them in the playoffs cmon bro he’s a the second best big in the league
The NBA MVP https://t.co/6DL9yTptec
@semaj5280 Here’s the thing about the nba Giannis wasn’t gonna win bc they weren’t gonna award it to him three years in a row. Joker deserved it 100% his stats back it up and you can’t deny that. Do you really think Bron deserved finals mvp in 2020 fuck no that should’ve been ADs.
@_Talkin_NBA Can you do a poll about how Jokic won’t be in the top 10 for MVP?<U+0001F923>

@the_picketfence @_Abner_Moreira @ESPNNBA @hardenbbq @tjfordbasketba1 Again that doesnt discount significant evidence that demonstrated he has the right to talk about work ethic, constantly in MVP conversation, constantly seen as a top player in the NBA, he is more than qualified to speak to those guys about work ethic and what it takes, stop it

@LxthuL @MrAdamAp @Snip3down I mean the term “Most Valuable Player” should weight just that. The winning team shouldn’t get the MVP unless the MVP is on that team. Like other sports IE NFL, NBA do a good job at that. 

But a fan vote? I suppose that’s a good way to be engaging but they don’t see all games.
Number 1 

Nikola Jokic (Nuggets) 

The reigning MVP of the NBA, Jokic is the most versatile Center of all time, he can play any position 1 through 5 he’s Denver’s go to scorer when Jamal Murray isn’t on the court, he led Denver to the Conference Semi’s in the post season
Number 1 

Steph Curry (Warriors) 

The best Point Guard currently in the NBA and some say the best point guard Ever. Despite falling short to the Lakers in the Play-in game this year, Steph Curry led the entire NBA in Points Per game and was in Top 5 MVP voting..
Number 3 

Chris Paul (Suns) 

Despite being 36 Years Old Chris Paul had an MVP calibre season, helping the Suns to make the 2 seed and helping them to the NBA Finals where they fell short to the Bucks. This was Chris’s first ever finals appearance in his career…
my official 2021-2022 nba predictions:

MVP: Julius Randle
DPOY: Mitchell Robinson
ROTY: Quentin Grimes
MIP: RJ Barrett
6MOTY: Immanuel Quickley
COTY: Tom Thibodeau
EOTY: Leon Rose
FMVP: Kemba Walker
Kd could be the best player in the nba. But hes not winning mvp in the situation hes in https://t.co/vEIPHafO0C
@Too_Much_Hoops It's telling to admit only an MVP can satiate one's demands of Siakam.

20 players make equal or less in salary. If P performed as, say, the 15th best NBA player (excl. rookie deals), he'd still be more than worth his $.

So, why only #1? It's about their hopes, not his play.
The general consensus of the last great game per sport is this.

Hockey: NHL 95/Sega
Baseball: MVP Baseball 05/PS2
Football: NFL Blitz/N64
Basketball: NBA 2k11/360
@CornetaWarriors Vem pra ser MVP, MIP, ALL NBA First Team
@RunitupBambino He get hurt every year, niggas can’t use the “if” he stay healthy excuse cuz the year Embiid stay healthy the sky will turn red , he walking around on a torn meniscus as we speak <U+0001F602> Embiid was never able to get his team to ECF &amp; individually Jokic is a MVP and 2x 1st team all nba
@ShaneMosleyWil1 @ArmandoSalguero NBA is a VERY different game than the NFL. Timing between you and your QB is invaluable. Every minute in practice makes you better. Go ask Aaron Rodgers on his first game back after not being in camp. Dude was the 32nd ranked QB in week 1 coming off of a recent MVP year!
He only had to win an NBA Championship and Finals MVP smhh racist ass country https://t.co/vPCHyvFgTp

@RichBoiAbe @hoopsdontstop Do you seriously want to compare the NBA history of the two cities?
We had the GOAT. New York hasn't even had an MVP in over half a century.
@PnRorPnP @leleeeii @PhoenixEyeFist @GarrettKnight17 @darwinchvz320 Well if you don’t believe in steals or whatever just look at Jordan PER (which was the highest record till Russ MVP season) and also Jordan had the highest plus/minus of all nba players, EVER

@rsandns @balldontstop Does mvp stand for “most skilled player”?? You can hate on Kyrie all you want but we’re talking about pure skill… Also I love how ppl try to downplay that shot lol. Coming back from 1-3, game 7, no one had scored for 3 minutes. That shot literally changed the nba forever

chip - brooklyn 
mvp - luka 
MIP - RJ barrett

@Itzkingslayer @Ant74467389 @Lakesh0wAidan Media members vote on MVP based on how their regular season went, it isn't an NBA ranking of ability. Nobody claims that. Next, you should base a top-10 list on whatever the hell it is grading. You should not blindly go by stats though because they never tell the whole story.
@NBA_Craze @Ant74467389 @Lakesh0wAidan Oh I see so when the nba is choosing the mvp or making a top 10 list we should go off the eye test and what fandoms on twitter think instead of stats Lmaoo
luka doncic will be the 2021/2022 NBA mvp
@EddyyNY @Basketballrugs @TheNBACentral @GQMagazine This has nothing to do w nostalgia ? It’s just one guy is a literal 2x mvp who averaged 50-40-90 shooting splits and one is a upcoming star on the worst team in the nba. You are sounding a lot like bag twitter rn man. Steve Nash is a hofer shai hasnt even been an all star
LISTEN: Doncic Is MVP Favorite, But Will Mavs Be Good Enough? https://t.co/b8uJzfURfw
@MLBRandomStats A problem a lot of casual fans have is a thinking about the MLB MVP the way they think about the NBA or NFL MVP. Michael Jordan or Tom Brady single handedly double a teams wins, because they could touch the ball on every offensive play. Vlad, Ohtani, etc only get so many ABs
@TheNBACentral Ja could win league mvp, nba finals mvp, dpoy, and scoring title and y’all will still say Zion should’ve been drafted ahead.
@VibrantTheory @RonJ25419113 @NateDaGreat70 @noIimitbryan @KingJames That's just stupid but I will play your game

Lebron never beat KD w/o Wade &amp; Bosh
Steph and Lebron play in the same era and have battled for both league MVP and NBA championships head to head; they are rivals

@B1ngr4m i know pels fans gonna say dame just bc it's AD. but before last szn, he was a consensus pick in everyone's top 5 players in the world .. let's not forget that theirs levels to this shit. AD has a top 3 MVP finish , 4 All-NBA 1st teams , 3x block champ , ASG MVP , &amp; NBA CHAMP.
@samuelsiphone @AdebayoPlsWin @TheRealJHair @BrasileiroWilt @RealBillRussell @NBA @celtics @BleacherReport @espn so, the dude who is seen as one of the greatest players ever, the dude who gets called superman by shaq and Gerad green.... pick someone who isn't an all time great dunker or has an mvp if "everyone" can do it

Again i will point out that the sixers get ZERO love from the NBA’s social media accounts. So far they posted a rookie highlight mix with no Maxey. A blocks comp with no sixers at all (3 all defense tho) top 100-20 plays with no sixers (mvp candidate, 1 seed)

I’m generally anti-badge on NBA Top Shot, but no MVP badge seems weird given Championship badge, myriad rookie badges, etc.

So calling it now: airdrop of a Rare MVP Moves Set to honor the supreme Nikola Jokic, dropped like Lamelo MGLE S2 based on Joker hodlers.
@RealSkipBayless @undisputed Why are they talking about NBA and LeBron in September? They don’t have nothing to talk about? No baseball talk? Especially wild card race? No MVP or cy young debate?
@itthatkid253 @Percussorr @GuapGarrett @NirTzouk @Heat_in_3 @FearGiannis Once again, I don’t care about accolades/rings. And I seriously doubt he would win any MVP or rings after 1991. Magic was lucky enough to feast against the weakest competition in NBA history (80’s western conference) so I doubt he’s making a finals after competition increased.
@HannibalLeonar1 @averagetico @sean_27upnext @STUDYTHEGOAT @getnickwright I mean tbf harden was able to lead his team to the playoffs multiple times while consistently finishing top 5 in MVP voting in those years, can’t say the same for Kai, but don’t it get twisted, he’s still one of the biggest buckets the nba has seen but harden is just better tbh

@SainAsylum Zbo only got suspended for that “punch” because the NBA didn’t want KD, who was about to be named MVP, eliminated from the playoffs.
@KyrieIrving is an NBA All-Star. He’s also an MVP at gaslighting on social media with “sort of vague yet crystal clear” statements.

He’s almost Trump-esque with his ability to speak out both sides of his mouth and pretend like the thing he just said isn’t the thing he just said.

@Serge03x @undisputed @ShannonSharpe Now no doubt Giannis resume is impressive regular MVP'S, defensive awards, NBA champion, Finals MVP. Problem is he have two obvious flaws in his game (free throw shooting &amp; just shooting overall) &amp; again Giannis said KD was better so I guess discuss it with the source lol.

Look, Vlad Jr is amazing…but Ohtani is the MVP. Dude has 44 bombs, and is one win away from 10 wins on the mound with a 3.2 ERA. Playoffs should have nothing to do with the MVP in baseball. One guy can’t take over a game like a QB or an NBA superstar

@RPMunson @showalter_max Does the guy making the most in the NBA, NFL or MLB win MVP? Negative. Rahm was the best player this year hands down.
LeBron had the best pure athletic moment of the 2016 NBA Finals but Kyrie Irving hit the coldest shot I’ve ever seen in a basketball game over the reigning unanimous MVP. Both iconic, but if we’re choosing I think Kyrie’s shot is the better moment of the 2 https://t.co/SDu2I2EUUB

@PlayoffPoole3 @ClippersNets Of course not, why would i think a guy who averaged 15/23/4 and 16/25/5 in his playoff career and who also is an 11x champion, 5x mvp, 12x all star, 11x all nba, 4x rebound champ is better than Curry?
@RationalPastime Lol yeah absolutely no chance I thought in 1999 he deserved it over Pedro. I would have voted for Pedro to win the NBA MVP and for a Nobel Prize. Maybe my opinion will have changed 20 years later if I look at it again but i seriously doubt it.
@RNgeno4real @overtime @russwest44 His name is Russell Westbrook. He’s an NBA player for the Lakers. He used to play for the Thunder for a long time. Played for UCLA in college. He actually won MVP in 2017.
@TMFjules @DroppYT_ Hell no ! every shot goes in now, nba players miss, alot, i think they should change it A TAD BIT MORE, but ill leave it as is cus if 2k changes it its gonna never gonna be good
@STUDYTHEGOAT @sean_27upnext @getnickwright My point is based on no matter what counting stat, efficiency stat or Advanced analytic you want to use, James Harden is better than Kyrie. Whatever accolades you want to use such as scoring leader, assist leader, MVP, all NBA teams, it doesn't matter, Harden is better.
Giannis’ five-season stretch from Most Improved Player to NBA Champion is truly remarkable when looking back at it:

2016-17:
MIP

2018-19:
NBA MVP

2019-20:
NBA MVP
DPOY

2020-21:
All-Star MVP
Finals MVP
NBA Champion

Imagine how much hardware he’ll have in five more years…
@KHBurner24 @FearGiannis Idk maybe just having the greatest basketball IQ in nba history. And the fact that he was a. 

-5x NBA champion 

-3x FMVP

-3x MVP

-12x all star

-2x all star game mvp

-9x all nba first team

@4TwoTymes @mraintfamousyet @thisisemdee @terrebking Exactly why he hasn’t won shit in the NBA, not even a MVP
Lil homie told the NBA MVP he don't sweat <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D> https://t.co/iHSZQ8rvU1
@Oscar__NBA he throws the ball from the 38??? it lands 4 yards into the end zone it’s like a 42 yard pass, editors note - i think kyler will win MVP just being an asshole
MVP, 1st team all nba, 2nd team all defense, 24.7-6.3-7.6 https://t.co/v7bZURYNdE
@aRoseCLE216 MJ has never played in an finals where he wasn't the leading scorer for the series or wasn't the finals MVP. He also never dropped 8 points in an NBA finals game nor did he ever lose an NBA finals, which Lebron did 6 times
@BSOLZ_ @LegendOfWinning Technically the 2014 clippers would also fit “MVP + All NBA + depth”, also the ‘12 thunder COULD be in that given 36% of their points came from bench, 2009/2013 Spurs
@DevanFink @MLBRandomStats I think the problem with the MVP is the fact that some ppl think that if the team of the said player doesnt make the playoffs all his production worth nothing, this frase just infuriate me "how valuable he can be if he can't lead his team to playoff" as if MLB were the NBA/NFL.

@CespedesBBQ Crazy that it’s such an issue to some people that the leagues play with one small rule change that gives fans preference, yet no one cares that the NL and AL still have different awards in 2021. Imagine an Eastern Conference and Western Conference MVP/ROY/etc in NHL/NBA. Crazy
@DevanFink I don’t understand the terror in awarding the same guy MVP every year if he deserves it. As if it gets old and is bad to give the most valuable guy MVP 5 times. NBA is like that too. Wayne Gretzky won the MVP his first 8 seasons in the NHL. Why? Because he clearly deserved it.

@SkogiesCards Nobody in the nba or nfl would win mvp being a loser like that
When the Lakers defeated the Indiana Pacers in Game 6 of the 2000 NBA Finals to secure the franchise’s 12th title, this was the net the team scored the championship-winning buckets in! Shaq was named Finals MVP after averaging 29.7 PPG and 13.6 RPG

@RichStapless @nbacommish17 It’s a complete no brainer. Since 2014 lebron has been in the finals every year but 2 seasons <U+0001F602><U+0001F602> he’s been FIRST TEAM all nba every year but 2 seasons meaning he was the best at the SF position. He won the greatest championship since that time span in 2016. Higher mvp finishes
@terrebking @mraintfamousyet @thisisemdee Maybe Kyle Lowry but Derozen, Gay, Conley haven't not no scoring title no mvp no all team nba no all defensive team from what I could remember so I highly doubt it lol that would wild
@thejtbeebe23 So funny you say that- I randomly saw a game that year in MSG and he got MVP chants at the line! Deserved, too. Apparently all his development happened in the NBA, most of that under MDA, who hated post ups. Maybe that was it? I hate that injuries got him man..he was special.
It’s just a ludicrous number. 

Giannis is the default MVP that everyone agrees is one of the best three players in the league and the only guy in the NBA on a definitely awesome team with just one superstar. Implied 11% is just ludicrous. https://t.co/cp5s30vqh9
Can I interest you in nearly 3 hours of NBA podcast goodness?

@SamQuinnCBS and I went lonnng on MVP, ROY, MIP, COY, 6MOY, DPOY, scoring and assists leader, and our one absolute free money NBA bet if the year.

Coming soon… <U+0001F440>
Fun podcast with @SamQuinnCBS on NBA award races…

We go long on MVP and why Giannis is such a good value bet, plus a ton of talk on what sort of profile usually wins Coach of the Year and Most Improved and who fits the bill.

@ExposingHarden @Jaylnc1 @TheSmooveBurner @BleacherReport @hardenbbq Any Nba baller can average 36 points and win mvp’s and be top 5 in nba conversations every year? Right…. <U+0001F602><U+0001F602> I guess because JR smith got a ring or Jeff Teague has a ring he is better then Harden
@Jaylnc1 @TheSmooveBurner @BleacherReport @hardenbbq He has been in top 5 mvp race almost every year for the past 6 years, He has won a MVP he had one of the craziest 40+ games streaks in NBA history. Averaged 36 points in a season and you telling me he doesn’t know about work ethic? You’re delusional

@staypuftmcfly @jay_bexx @MLBNetwork Trout has won recently without being on a contender. Being on a contender is not essential to winning the MVP. That's the NFL and NBA. Maybe you should stick to those.

@Ogulcan24M @BleacherReport @hardenbbq Considering he’s one of only 35 players in the history of the nba to win an mvp i think yeah he can speak about having a good work ethic
@RiLy456 @Flashy_JWl @StephHoopz @antonin_org 3 x nba champion while bein a unanimous mVp lebron ain do det <U+0001F62D> fuckin goof
@Jaylnc1 @BleacherReport @hardenbbq I mean he’s in the NBA and a MVP Winner

@Jordan53039415 Nah bro she was sufficiently cooked. But there's more than one crowd on this app too. Your scenario is hard to gauge because the exact same thing kinda could never happen to an NBA All-Star/champion/MVP. Very apples and oranges. But sure, if he did something comparable,definitely

@calrissian__ @NotYou_83 @msjnba Ok, but he was 17, not a finished product. Also, other young European prospects (e.g. Pau Gasol) went to the NBA and were successful *before* they had a chance at becoming Euroleague MVP.

In Europe *everyone* knew he'd be a superstar. Many Americans thought they knew better.

If nba players could hoop with hoodies on as part of their uniforms, say goodbye to trying to establish a MVP.
@NotYou_83 @msjnba To be fair. NBA has seen it’s fair share of Euroleague MVP’s come over or guys who would go on to be MVP’s. He’s literally the 1st to become a superstar player.
@RealDavidsWorld @Yipayo88 @GoatPlaymaker Im not an NBA fan, Im a LAker fan. I dont cheer on any other team. So when PG13 does something of merit, anything like MVP, DPOY or scoring title, then you wont have to lobby for credit, PG13 will have earned
@antonin_org So like it not, he is the only player in NBA history to get an  unanimous decision for MVP of the league. Noooooooo other players have done it.
So suck it he's it up. Basketball is about making <U+0001FAA3><U+0001FAA3>. Be Ray C all you want  <U+0001F451> Curry has taken the show.

@ScottyMacThinks He’s the most outstanding player. Should always be an award for that because it differs from MVP. For example, Michael Jordan was the NBA’s Most Outstanding Player for over a decade but there were other legit MVP winners in that window.

@ArshadDahlan123 @Puffball23 @DaneMooreNBA Manu had 25 and was Euroligue MVP when he came to the NBA, Bolmaro has similar skills and potential talent, but he's gonna need more time to develop his game into a NBA player.
Hopefully Prigioni as assistant coach would help him on this transition

@cadentank @jonmorosi @MLB @fangraphs @MLBNetwork Lol trout has 3 mvp’s and we weren’t above .500 so lol your statement is flawed. If it’s the NBA yeah sure a player on a good team. But it takes a whole team in the MLB. Cmon bro be smarter. Switch Vlad and Ohtani. Blue jays still a playoff team, angels still fourth.
@gmhunter22 Understand that I know Lamar is actively working on that skill and from all accounts has put the time in, has been an mvp and will get a massive deal as deserved. I’m saying that teams are fearing his arm less and less like NBA teams stopped guarding Ben’s jumper.
Quite the shame that when people talk about the greatest basketball players, Kareem is often ignored in favor of MJ and others. He won 6 titles,  like Mike, more mvp's (6), is career scoring leader, top rebounder and defender, and had the most unstoppable shot in NBA history.
I’m not tripping when I say this right , but I made the analogy that Derrick Rose is the Wale of the NBA , his MVP/prime season is Wale’s More About Nothing/ MMG’ Ambition run , Rose’s Injury and Wale antics and craziness put him on the derail , both can have that crazy
@BluejaysAlways Awards in other leagues are given based on player performance and where his team stands. I don't see MVP's being handed out in NBA, NFL or NHL if your team stinks.

@jonmorosi If the Jays make the playoffs, Vlad should win MVP, triple crown or not. Ohtani is having a season unlike anything else, but Angels still won’t make the playoffs. How many other major sport leagues (NFL, NBA, NHL) have constantly named MVPs for losing/non-playoff teams?
1. There needs to be an All-NBA-type PGA Tour team. "Here are the five guys that mattered this year."

2. There should be a majors-only POY. Akin to Finals MVP.

Rahm would have been on the first and won the second, which better contextualizes his year.

@uwurozes @MrCeeWorld @WrestleFeatures @fightbobby MVP would have to carry that feud promo-wise. Lashley’s gotten better though.
@stephenasmith @michaelirvin88 @nflnetwork Watching you argue with Irvin about greatest play maker in sports. Brady or Lebron. You blab about Lebron going to 10 NBA finals. Haha ya, he is also 4-6 in that. Brady went to 10 SuperBowls, he went 7-3. Hmm. <U+0001F914> Lebron NBA Finals MVP 4 times. Brady NFL Super Bowl MVP 5 times.
