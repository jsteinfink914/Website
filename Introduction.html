    &emsp; Each NBA offseason, NBA GM's search the available free agent pool to sign players they believe will help improve their team. 
    These decisions can have a significant impact on team success, especially in the modern NBA where player movement is the new norm. 
    NBA fans will be familiar with teams such as the Miami Heat from the early 2010s, which was built in free agency with the additions of Lebron James 
    and Chris Bosh joining Dwayne Wade. Also, when Kevin Durant joined the Golden State Warriors, it led to the first 73 win season in NBA history, 
    breaking the Michael Jordan Bulls record of 72. Lastly, and most recently, the superteam in Brooklyn, made up of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving,
    and James Harden, were all added through free agency. Examples of franchises overpaying for players is more widespread than successes, plaguing 
    franchises like the Charlotte Hornets and the New Yok Knicks for years. 
    <br><br>
    &emsp;Identifying players who can help is relatively easy, but figuring out how much they are/should be worth is much more challenging. In the 
    current NBA, identifying undervalued and overvalued players is absolutely critical to building a team contending for a championship. However, player 
    valuation becomes even more difficult when considering the relatively complex NBA salary cap. The salary cap is a soft cap system in which the cap 
    is determined by a split in revenue between owners and players (a 50/50 split was enacted after a lockout at the beginning of the 2011-2012 season). 
    With the NBA's growing popularity, the salary cap has increased dramatically, with a notable exception being a sharp decrease in 2021-2022 due to the
    COVID-19 pandemic. Some notable aspects of the cap include the luxury tax, a mid-level exception, and Bird Rights:
    </p>
    <h3>Luxury Tax</h3>
    <p>The luxury tax is a mechanism that punishes teams who exceed the salary cap by imposing a progressive tax; the more a team exceeds the cap, 
    the more they have to pay. For instance, teams between $0 and $5 million over the cap have to pay $1.50 for each dollar in this range (making the 
    maximum for this level being $7.5 million). The penalty increases to $1.75 per dollar in the range of $5-$9 million over the cap 
    (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mortenjensen/2020/05/11/nba-is-facing-a-luxury-tax-problemshould-the-amnesty-clause-return/?sh=2e1fefe374ce">Jensen 2020</a>).</p>
    <h3>Mid-level Exception</h3>
    <p>The mid-level exception allows teams who are close to or above the soft cap to continue improving teams by allowing them to offer a player
    a "mid-level" salary (generally around the league average salary until recently due to the salary cap explosion) and now settles around $5-6 million 
    which is below the league average of $8 million (<a target='_blank' href="https://hoopshype.com/2016/11/04/hoopshype-explains-what-is-the-nba-mid-level-exception/">Honkasolo 2016</a>). </p>
    <h3>Bird Rights</h3>
    <p>"Bird Rights" allow teams to resign their veteran free agents and exceed the salary cap for qualifying players. Generally, being a qualified
    player means that they have been on the team for multiple previous seasons; 3 for qualifying players and 2 for early qualifiers (<a target="_blank" href="https://cbabreakdown.com/free-agency/#qualifying-veteran-free-agent">Freedman 2019</a>). 
    These exceptions are used to promote parity in the league and "level the playing field" for small-market teams. Without these rules, when these teams
    are attempting to keep a free agent, a larger market team could in theory offer more money (and absorb any luxury tax penalty), 
    thus out competing the less wealthy team. This exception helps correct that issue.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
    &emsp;These exceptions create challenges for analysis of salaries as they are widespread, but do not necessarily reflect a player's "true value"
    due to the constraints of the salary cap. There are also issues regarding player preferences. For instance, it is relatively common to see 
    players entering the twilight of their careers (like Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, and Andre Drummond) opt to take a pay cut in order 
    to be on a championship contending team.
    </p>
    <p>
    &emsp;Quantifying player value requires deeper consideration for specific variables; not only past statistics, but also consideration
    for context-dependent variables such as age, team changes, outlier performances in contract years (which can skew perceptions of value dramatically).
    Additionally, there are off-the-court considerations--such as starpower and chemistry--that can affect a player's value in the market. The goal of this 
    project is to attempt to use available data to predict player salary, and by doing so help identify appropriate salaries for players with a focus 
    on undervalued players. With this in mind, some questions to be investigated are:
    </p>
    <ol style="font-size:20px;">
    <li>How well can statistics predict market value (salary)?</li>
    <li>What factors outside of on-court performance affect salary (starpower, 2k ratings)?</li>
    <li>What makes a star a star?</li>
    <li>Do certain statistics matter more than others with regard to perceived value?</li>
    <li>How much of an effect do qualitative factors like age,experience, and height factor in to salary?</li>
    <li>How does player improvement factor in (who is worth more - a player with solid, consistent performance, or someone who has improved their numbers in each of the last X years)?</li>
    <li>Do teams have different strategies for offering a salary (are some teams more predictable than others)?</li>
    <li>Do certain variables become more important when offering contracts to starters versus bench players? (Do rebounds and turnovers matter more for bench players than starters?)</li>
    </ol>
