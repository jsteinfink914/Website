Kick vs. 4th and 15: An optionality Proposal for the NFL</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            With
the game on the line and down by one possession after scoring a touchdown in
the NFL, a team has minimal opportunity to get the ball back without much time
going off the clock. In fact, there is only one option open to a team to regain
possession immediately: the onside kick. When a team does this, the kicker
attempts to kick the ball more than 10 yards (to avoid a penalty) but close
enough where their own team can recover the ball before the opposing team does.
When expecting it, the opposing team will go into an onside kick formation and
stack their players in the likely recovery zone. One can imagine that the
probability of executing this desperation play is low, and this is true as it
converts on average 13.3% of the time since 2012, according to my own analysis.
However, this is no longer the case since the rules changed in the 2018 NFL
season. In an effort to reduce concussions and make kickoffs safer in general,
the NFL decided to no longer allow the kicking team to get a running start
through the 35 yard line, and instead they must remain stationary until the
ball is kicked.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup><sup><span
lang=EN style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[1]</span></sup></sup></a>
To be sure, this policy has been effective as it has led to a 38% reduction in
concussions suffered on kickoffs.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup><sup><span
lang=EN style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[2]</span></sup></sup></a>
However, it also neutralized the effectiveness of the onside kick. More numbers
will be discussed later, but the conversion rate has dropped significantly
since the change, from 15.1% to 10.5%. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Knowing
of this effect, the Philadelphia Eagles proposed a possible rule change in 2019
and again in 2020. They wanted to allow teams to run a 4th and 15 play from
their own 25 yard line in lieu of an onside kick.<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup><sup><span lang=EN style='font-size:13.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[3]</span></sup></sup></a>
Importantly, the play would be an untimed down and if a penalty hurting the
offense were to occur (imagine a5 yard false start penalty) the team would
still have to carry out the attempt from their new down and distance (in this
case, a 4th and 20 from their own 20 yard line). The proposal has been tabled
both times, but there has been discussion on it, and some think it will provide
an injection of excitement to late-game situations. This document aims to add
further credence to the proposal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><u><span lang=EN style='font-size:
13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Methodology</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            To
perform the analysis on the onside kick, 4th down option policy, the
open-source programming software R was used. Data was pulled from the nflreadr
library which is a package meant for easy access to the nflverse project, a set
of packages meant to provide data for the NFL.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"
title=""><sup><sup><span lang=EN style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[4]</span></sup></sup></a> Using this
package, play-by-play data could be obtained. For the project, data from
2012-2021 NFL seasons was collected (2012 was when the kickoff yardline was
pushed forward from the 30 to the 35 and touchbacks were moved from the 20 to
the 25 yard line). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>To
isolate onside kick data, every play (row entry) has a column called “play
type.” Taking only plays with “kickoff” as the play type and containing the
word “Onside”  in the description column allowed for the isolation of the 609
onside kick attempts since 2012. For determining whether or not the onside kick
was recovered, the description column, thankfully, contained the word
“RECOVERED” in all caps if the kick was indeed recovered. This signal </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN style='font-size:

a binary variable where 1 equals a recovered onside kick and 0, a non-recovered
onside kick.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>To
isolate 4th down data, a column called “down” was used which stored the current
down. Taking only the rows where down equals 4 yields 41,192 4th down attempts
since 2012. From there, 5 yard intervals were taken and used for the analysis
(4th and 1-5, 6-10,11-15,16-20,20-25). Importantly, many 4th down plays are
punts, so it was critical to filter out plays that were not “pass” or “run”
plays as listed in the “play type” column. Lastly, a column called “first down”
represents a binary variable where 1 indicates a successful first down, and 0 a
turnover on downs.</span></p>

we see that onside kick attempts have remained relatively consistent, around 60
each year. The rule changes in 2018 did not seem to have much of an effect on
attempts, which makes sense; a desperate team is still going to attempt an onside
kick no matter the odds because it is their only option. However, in the bottom
chart one can see that after the rule change, the onside kick conversion rate
seems to drop. To see if this is significant, a hypothesis testing procedure
must be performed where the null hypothesis is that the onside kick conversion
rates before and after the rule change are equivalent.</span></p>

significant at the 10% level and with more samples could be significant at the
5% level. The difference in mean conversion rate pre 2018 and post 2018 is
4.67%, as it dropped from 15.1% to 10.5%.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            These
results indicate the usefulness of a potential 4th and 20 option in the NFL.
Since rule changes in 2018 prevented kicking teams from getting a running
start, the onside kick conversion rate has dropped significantly (from 15% to
10%). After investigating 4th down scenarios, specifically from 15-20 yards and
20-25 yards, it appears that both of these options are statistically similar in
terms of conversion rate when compared to the new rate of onside kick success.
In fact, it appears that these options resemble more closely the success rate
of onside kicks before the rule change. Given that the rule change was meant to
limit concussions and not to limit late game theatrics, lowering the
probability of the “desperation chance” was not the intended effect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Given
that NFL teams make the majority of their revenue from ticket sales,<a
href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup><sup><span lang=EN
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[7]</span></sup></sup></a>
a key driver of revenue growth is increased TV ratings and viewership. More
viewers means more advertising dollars, and both surprise and suspense have
been shown to be correlated with increased TV ratings. As a result, improving
the likelihood that surprising and suspenseful situations will take place can
lead to significant revenue inflows. Additionally, it has been shown that
commercials will be more effective following surprising and suspenseful
moments, and as a result these slots can be sold for more money.<a href="#_ftn8"
name="_ftnref8" title=""><sup><sup><span lang=EN style='font-size:13.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[8]</span></sup></sup></a>
Thus boosting late game surprise and suspense is one of the most economically
efficient ways to boost TV revenue as the marginal effects at the end of games
loom the largest. By allowing for a 4th and 15 attempt, surprise and suspense
will increase as late game comebacks will have a higher probability ascribed to
them. Beyond simply improving revenue, the fan experience may benefit from the
prospect of more intense competition. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><u><span lang=EN style='font-size:
13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Conclusion</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Money
matters in the NFL and TV dollars are the main source of revenue. Improving TV
ratings presents a clear pathway towards improving revenues and increasing
surprise and suspense in games is a sound strategy to utilize in pursuit of
this goal. Introducing a 4th and 15 option in lieu of an onside kick will
return to the losing team an opportunity to make a late game comeback with
similar likelihood as the pre-2018 onside kick while potentially boosting TV
revenues. This proposal has the potential to benefit owners, players, and fans.
As a result, a one year trial period in which teams can take the 4th and 15
option should be considered. </span></p>
