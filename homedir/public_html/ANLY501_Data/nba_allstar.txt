Indianapolis can have NCAA national championships, Final Fours, entire NCAA Tourneys… B10 Championship, NBA Allstar weekends… Super Bowls… but @WWE won’t bring a PPV here ever… yet recycles Brooklyn, Philly, Houston, Santa Carla, etc every 3-4 months and pays 2-3x as much<U+0001F644>
@thehalestone What if Pop saw a bunch of international teams w/a bunch of no named players,who most arent good enough or are too old to be in the NBA,take team USA filled with“allstar” talent to the brink of losses multiple times,and saw how well it worked.Let the games be played first.
@DerekBodnerNBA The same fanbase that gave him standing ovations when he made 3s. Think about that for a second. Fans give NBA Allstar standing ovations for making a jumper. <U+0001F92F><U+0001F92F><U+0001F92F><U+0001F92F>
@ClassicJoeyMac @JClarkNBCS @NBCPhiladelphia He has been wdym? He was a allstar all nba a mvp candidate, he busted his ass in the playoffs, but then we got crybaby Ben Simmons leaving cause we got angry he lost us the series. Put respect on Joel’s name
@NBA @Chriswood_5 @HoustonRockets Congrats goat future allstar @Chriswood_5
@RobertSwank15 @TheBigGuard @PHLSixersNation Did you say @BenSimmons25 HAS the ability to be good really? He's a 3X allstar in his first 4 years should be 4X beings he was snubbed as a rookie and he's hands down the best defender in the @NBA so because he isn't shooting alot has to go? Makes perfect sense???
@_Misael5 @HoopHistory44 Here is an example of the difference that 25lbs make. Karl Anthony Towns was viewed as, possibly, the 2nd best power forward in the NBA behind Anthony Davis and an Allstar. Wolves moved him to center. Not an Allstar, not talked about, not 1st, 2nd, 3rd team NBA. Difference 25lbs.

@OMasood8842 @BadNBATakes_ @KGsGOAT @aRoseCLE216 How’s u make all nba or even an allstar team then
@William34709703 @LeBronfactcheck Bosh was an allstar ion the heat and didn’t play an all nba role so his team could win. Basketball reference dosent tell full story
@mil1ca Funny right. He’s viewed as untouchable now from the *twitter* fanbase even for players who are all nba/allstar caliber. As a fan of the team, I would say no, but if this is all it took for the warriros to acquire Simmons, they can’t say no imo.
@rachelleigh_11 @ram_solfe you didn't tell me you were an NBA allstar you Shadow of the Colossus lookin mf
@Martina They should what NBA allstar game dies now. Select two captains and let them draft a team live from a group of top players.

Laver cup needs to change format, why not do a draft like the nba allstar game? #LaverCup
@Celtics32287699 @LeBronfactcheck He made All NBA once as the best player on his team. Dwyane Wade 8x LeBron 17 All defensive Dwade 3x LeBron 6 Bosh 0.00. Allstar means you’re among the most popular players in half of the league. All nba speaks for itself
@Celtics32287699 @LeBronfactcheck All NBA is not a stat it’s an accolade. It means you’re considered to be in the top 3 at your position in the league period. Same with all defense. It means you’re the elite of the elite, that’s not an Allstar

Nah you snubbing Randle after an Allstar and All NBA season is ludacris. https://t.co/rlz8TXTcl5
@TheA1God And one went from 6th man on a stacked college team to becoming an NBA AllStar and reach an NBA Finals as one of the leagues most lethal scorers. 

The other reached the NBA finals in his rookie year while setting multiple playoff records that were stood for some 3 decades.
@mark_skulski @PrimeTimeRURS Because I’m focused on placing his existing skillset in today’s league. Take bird from the 80s-90s and place him in today’s NBA. My whole point is with his skillset would he succeed and thrive and be a top NBA allstar in today’s game
ANTHONY DAVIS SHOULD HAVE 3 DPOY AWARDS BEFORE THE AGE OF 28. Just remember that. Instead the NBA gave it to a 7 foot soft guy that couldn’t make the allstar game so had to give him some type of award to make him feel important
@ShaleEdman @NicoleMcMilllon If I were you, I would stop using the Pippen and Phil Jackson analogy. Kinda stupid harping on 1 teammate, who never even made it out of the 2nd round as the leader of a team with multiple allstar/NBA teammates
@ynfyb @the_grey_life @Mambaagod @Capalot4Mo Pippen was 1 teammate lol

Lebron has had COUNTLESS HOF/ALL NBA/ALLSTAR teammates

There’s no case nor comparison

Take the MJ hate somewhere else ladies, stop with the Twitter propaganda &amp; do some REAL research. https://t.co/KrKiw4PUOT
@Ogarytv @VetteIista @TheNBACentral How is the weakest?u still have a multiple  ALLSTAR/ all nba defense player, a #1 drafted big man, Wiggins avr 19/5 &amp; played stellar perimeter defense, oubre avr  15/6 also played stellar defense that's not a trash team at all! Thas more than what Luka had
@pgyoungfly @Hoopassion @justbirane @JustRyCole Who said they sucked? Find me a tweet that says that. I bet you can't. Kyrie was the only allstar on the Celtics going against the bucks that had the best record in the NBA and the MVP. Those are facts. Not my opinion. They lost to a better team.
@pgyoungfly @Hoopassion @justbirane @JustRyCole How am i talking like that? Are you just imagining shit in your head ? I said Kyrie was the only allstar on the Celtics. That's a fact. I said the bucks had the best record in the nba and the mvp. That's a fact. So why are you putting extra shit i ain't say? I know what they did https://t.co/XwCAD5C7xZ
@McfcKDB_ @brookshuncho2 @MauUprising @Patsandbball @LeGeneralJ @onlytaron @TheHoopCentral So you're judging Kyrie based on one year with a team he was traded to when he was the only allstar on that team that year. Hayward was coming off a terrible injury. Tatum in his 2nd year. Brown in his 3rd. They lost to the bucks with the best record in the nba and MVP.
@NYKfan10304 @STUDYTHEGOAT @ClippersNets You think based on what? Embid just lost to the hawks in the 2nd round. At least when Kyrie lost in the 2nd round to the bucks, the bucks had the best record in the NBA and MVP and Kyrie was the only allstar on the Celtics that year. So you think based on what?
@Hoopassion @pgyoungfly @justbirane @JustRyCole That's not a sweep. So next time make sure you get it right so you look a little less dumb. The Celtics with Kyrie lost in the 2nd round 4-1 to the bucks. The bucks that had the best record in the NBA and the MVP. Kyrie was the only allstar on the Celtics. No Shame in that
@SGG_hq “Hey famous NBA Allstar Ben Simmons, can I get a picture” and then ask him how it felt when Kawhi ripped his heart out.
@loggy1890 @arxanii "blew an 18 pt lead in the 2018 WCF game 6" as if he wasn't going against 2 MVP's, 1 DPOY/Allstar, 1 all NBA allstar, and 1 all NBA defensive FMVP by HIMSELF lmao. 

it was embarassing for the other "clutch" stars that it even got that close.
@realeverywriter I'd feel like I had "made it" as an author when I get invited to play in the celebrity basketball match during NBA Allstar Weekend.

But there would be plenty of measurable successes prior to that (the movie of my life... the action figure... the video game...).

MIP ... why would you not want that guy on your team?  how is this even real life?
@YourProcessGuy @agriffinmitsu @LVBenchWarmers @ScottyDrowned So... I'm pretty sure Ben had 40 this year, if he was so bad why was he an 3x Allstar and rookie of the year. Is he improving no but there is much more to this story than ben not shooting. NBA players shouldn't be versed in PR however organizations and leadership should.
Instead of the Allstar game just let nba Twitter have dinner with jigger with a rack of money balls.
@CarmichaelDave Can we stop jinxing this rookies career with high expectations jesus some of yall think hes a future allstar we haven't even seen him play 1 minute of nba basketball yet
So let me get this straight.

@J30_RANDLE leads @nyknicks to 4th seed makes the allstar (top 30 player).. get a all nba selection (top 15 player) got paid!!! But ya got him ranked 41!

No @RjBarrett6 while he's started his career on historical footing

YA DONT KNOW BASKETBALL!! https://t.co/FH5G6RERO7

@RedNinetyFour I just don't understand how quickley ben becomes underrated.

I still think he underperformed in playoffs and has to improve but guys ben is 3 time allstar,the guy has been all nba, and he is IMO the best defender in the league only at 25.

Not all top 5pick become allstars.
@ResponsibleRoc1 yeah fringe allstar is a big stretch for Wood imo. Thats like top 30-40 and I don't think he's that
@Oscar__NBA Top twenty is a bit much imo and Wood is like fringe allstar level, I do think KAT is better though and kinda underrated at this point, but so far im being massacred for even suggesting this <U+0001F62D>
@GramSchwan @edwards_burner @SixersTre @katszn_ @wojespn simmons is coming off an allstar and all nba defensive team season and malik beasley is a role player, at least simmons and ant are close.
@MaffieuMufasa For a 3 time Allstar, 2 time NBA first team all defense, 24 year old emerging superstar that can guard 1 through 4. Still hasn’t reached his peak. Let’s be honest you can win a ship with Harden and KD why not add defensive and playmaking
@DavidZavac @BenAxelrod Rudy Golbert is. 2x allstar and 4x all NBA....

He's not a star either

@MitchellRossman @jakeDclifton @JustRyCole Well when that player is called a allstar and gets a shit ton of money but doesn’t improve at all ever since he came to the nba while u see other players improve aka Greek freak u gonna be pissed off sixers shouldn’t have lost to the hawks and it’s Ben fault
Ben Simmons is a multiple time allstar and one of the 5 best defenders in the nba — he is not in the top 25 when it comes to the worst contracts in the nba. 

Hes 25 years old and has had a tough stylistic fit next to embiid. https://t.co/EXsJEvkvDB
Hell I love KPJ but niggas talking like he a 3x allstar chill Benjamin Simmons an Allstar and All NBA nigga
Fantastic look at Jaylen Brown @FCHWPO by @MarcJSpears on why representation matters.Brad Stevens always tells me “Jaylen is an exceptional basketball player,AllStar,but he’s destined to make a bigger contribution to our world than just hoops” Stevens is <U+0001F4AF>https://t.co/UK6xB3229k https://t.co/6N0rRpKdiS
@TrevStoresWFT There is no place he goes that will make the team he goes to better and satisfy the 76ers at the same time… cus 76ers don’t want young players or picks they want a legit nba allstar .. and no team has one to trade If they also still wanna compete … idk where he goes ?
@ESPNPlus @ESPNNBA @stephenasmith He’s a 3 time allstar , top 5 defender in the nba who lacks motivation? I’d take that every day of the week
@BenSimmons25 wow u stole a lot of money <U+0001F4B0> from the sixers and u can't shoot "Allstar" lmao<U+0001F606> your a bitch u cry baby!! u soft <U+0001F921>  u really aren't  built for this city but it doesn't look like so far no nba teams want your soft ass u little bitch.i hope the 76rs don't trade u.
@JazzJohnson10 @geola388 @JD_DUNHAM @wojespn So you would rather give up a allstar who could be a competent NBA scorer for Ben Simmons? Someone who can’t even shoot a free throw
@aznfusion77 @CadePistons @TheNBACentral Part 2:

And that's absurd nba lost the balance, most regular season games look like defenseless allstar games or 3pt shootouts. Players get TDs and 50 point ganes each night. Don't like this development. I prefer hard fought 99-97 games more than those d- intenseless 143-137 gms
@Petty_Hardaway @kingthorfinn1 @YamiSanKev @wojespn It’s pretty hilarious how a 3x NBA Allstar cannot shoot a basketball
NBA Allstar Ben Simmons quits basketball to go full time NFT's and Crypto. @thenftattorney 

-Sauces https://t.co/n4QXn21GX0
@GoodmanHoops Remember that next season that he will be better than Zion lol..Zion could have been a nba allstar as a rookie
@KingPush19 @arxanii I mean wood was an injury away from being an allstar, simmons is an allstar, kpj showed flashes of an all nba caliber player at 20 so it’s normal to think he’ll take the next step, and green was the most nba ready scorer in the draft, along with a REALLY deep bench, 7-8 seed team
@R2RFrayo @ClutchPointsApp @blakegriffin23 @KingJames No they weren’t, KG was and 3rd team all nba, Paul peirce wasn’t and Ray Allen wasn’t but then added as a replacement to the allstar game when someone couldn’t play. Also Allen had double ankle surgery, PP missed half the season in 2007. Don’t make stuff up
@JCrossover @Ballislife I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU JAMAL THE RESPECT FANS SHOW YOU??? THEN YOU DISRESPECT THIS BRO MJ FOR WHATEVER REASON? PETTY DUDE??? SO YOU THAT YOUNG TO NOT KNOW ONLY 2 PEOPLE IN NBA HISTORY DID MVP/DPOY/ALLSTAR MVP???

He looks healthy rn too.

I’m calling it early. Russell Westbrook will be the best player on the Lakers this year.
@tjgrace62 @senpaiseauxkun @jrsmithhenny @HilltopNBA 3x Allstar 3x All NBA and a MVP (more All Nba selections than cousins) In 6 seasons. While Cousins has 4x Allstar 2x All Nba in his 12 year career.
@FootballKennel Approval of the lakefront development is a necessity. The draft  this year, a superbowl run plus next year's NBA Allstar game revenue will help push that through hopefully.

NBA needs to bring back players wearing their own jerseys in the Allstar games
@chmpagnemami No one cares about NBA games until after the AllStar Break.
@EmberCLE Maybe our 4 1st round draft picks who are NBA ready and borderline allstar Christian Wood and new signing Daniel Theis?
Or idk best rookie defender last year,Tate and Kenyon Martin Jr
Just say so if you hate the rockets lol
On this day last year we had former NBA &amp; ABA Allstar Swen Nater on the podcast! Incredible life &amp; basketball journey with great stories about John Wooden,NCAA titles,Bill Walton,ABA lifestyle, becoming a magician &amp; MUCH more!

@el_budget he is a generational talent. you wont find anyone with as many allstar/all nba/career totals with a worse winning %. a generational loser is still generational
