        Currently, I am a graduate student at Georgetown University working towards a degree in the Data Science and 
        Analytics Program. I also majored in Economics with a double minor in Psychology and Business Administration 
        - with a focus in Finance - during my undergraduate time at Georgetown. My resume can be found 
        <a href = "Steinfink_Resume.pdf" target = "_blank">here</a>.

        I have always prided myself on my work ethic, and now I believe I have the practical skills that can make
        me a productive member of many teams. My background is largely grounded in Economics and Finance, and I have 
        worked as a consultant and financial analyst during my time in undergrad.
        Additionally, I spent this summer performing analytical work for the federal contractor, Acumen, to provide 
        support to the Medicare program, specifically by quantifying the savings gained from program integrity efforts. 
        In this role, I worked with large and secure datasets along with languages like SAS and SQL to perform analyses. 
        My work in the M.S. Data Science and Analytics program has given me rigorous analytical skill using statistical 
        and programming knowledge (mainly in Python and R) to perform full machine learning analyses. I am also versed in leveraging cloud computing 
        architectures like Data Bricks and AWS.
        <br>
        Outside of school, I am an avid sports fan, especially of the NBA (if you couldn't tell from the portfolio) and
        NFL, and have grown up during the era of analytics and sports merging. Watching that development has deepened my 
        interest in sports and is part of the reason why I decided to pursue Data Science work in the first place.

        Looking forward, I have a deep interest in sports, finance, and climate-related issues and plan to
        utilize my education to work towards progress in any or all of these areas of 
        society. Even broader than that however, I feel that data will be used in almost every industry looking to improve
        (hopefully all) and I would like to be a force that helps make these improvements happen.

        This portfolio thus far contains the work for the first 7 of 10 classes completed as part of the Masters program, and is meant
        to be a completely transparent guide for the work that has been completed. The projects are listed more or less in chronological order 
        of completion and show a progression of my skills as a Data Scientist over time. All of the code for each project can be found at my 
        <a href = "https://github.com/jsteinfink914/Projects" target = "_blank"> github repo</a>.
